NANCY-JASMINE,NIKKOLAS   693-31-18-1                VISIT DATE: 04/28/93

The patient was seen, interviewed and examined by myself as well as 

Dr. Judd whose note I have reviewed, and whose findings I have 

confirmed. 

HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  This patient is a 68 year-old 

male who presents with slurred speech.  The patient has a history 

of a prior cerebrovascular accident with residual right sided 

deficit.  One day prior to arrival, the patient was found to have 

increasing slurring of speech and he was found to increasing 

weakness over his baseline on the right side.  The patient arrives 

without acute complaints except for difficulty speaking.  He denies 

any headache.  He also does complain of some throat pain. 

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Review of systems is as per the written note.  

The patient denies fevers, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath 

or dysphagia.  

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  The patient's past medical history is 

significant for hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cerebrovascular 

accident and otherwise as per the written note.

MEDICATIONS:  The patient's medications include Tylenol, aspirin, 

Avenida, Glucophage, Zoloft, hydrochlorothiazide, metoprolol and 

otherwise as per the written note.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies. 

SOCIAL HISTORY AND FAMILY HISTORY:  The patient's social history 

and family history are as per the written note and are significant 

for past tobacco use and no alcohol use.  He lives with family and 

goes to a day care facility.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  GENERAL:  The patient is a well nourished 

male in no acute distress.  VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 97, pulse 62, 

respiratory rate 16, blood pressure 163/96, oxygen saturation 100% 

on room air.  NECK:  Supple with full range of motion.  No nuchal 

rigidity.  LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally with good air 

movement.  CARDIAC:  Regular with ectopy.  No murmur is 

auscultated.  NEUROLOGIC:  Alert, oriented x 3, dysarthric.  Finger 

to nose is within normal limits bilaterally.  There is 5/5 motor 

strength throughout the left upper extremity and left lower 

extremity.  The right upper extremity and right lower extremity 

there is 3/5 motor strength throughout all motor groups tested.  

The patient is able to follow all commands.  His ability to 

understand appears to be completely intact.  

Further details of the patient's physical examination are as per 

the written note.

LABORATORY EVALUATION:  Laboratory studies are significant for a 

glucose of 195, BUN of 14, creatinine of 1.2, bicarbonate of 26, CK 

of 68, toxicology screen which is negative, troponin of 0.04, white 

count of 7.4, hematocrit of 42.0, platelets of 327 and a urinalysis 

that is pending.  A head CT is also pending.

THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  The patient was interviewed and 

examined in the emergency department.  His past medical records 

were reviewed.  The patient has new neurologic findings on top of 

an old cerebrovascular accident.   

CONSULTATIONS (including PCP):  The neurology service was therefore 

consulted and a head CT was ordered.  The patient will be admitted 

to the neurology service for further work up and he will likely 

also undergo an MRI/MRA.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  Cerebrovascular accident.

DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  The patient is 

admitted to the neurology service in satisfactory condition.

Patient Name: CURTIS, OM;  MRN: 7682941

Dictated at: 05/21/88 by VICTOR R. GOMES, M.D. 



Mr. Curtis returns with a history of ureteral stones, BPH, and dysuria.  He has not had any stone passage in the last six months.  He has passed some tissue, and had some gross hematuria with his last visit, but has not had any symptoms since then. 

  

With his BPH, he has not had any significant worsening of his nocturia or daytime frequency.  He feels as if he is emptying his bladder well now on the Cardura.  He did have some dysuria, and Dr. Geiger gave him a pill which seems to have helped him.  

 

His review of systems today is negative.  His past medical history is unchanged, and he is continuing with a cholesterol medication, a pill for burning, Cardura, and Atenolol. 

  

On physical examination, his vital signs show him to be well-nourished and well-developed.  His respirations are 14.  His pulse is regular.  A general examination shows his neck to be supple.  He is alert and oriented x 3.  He has no labored breathing.  He has no palpable groin adenopathy.  His skin has normal turgor, and his cardiovascular exam shows no JVD.

   

A complete GU examination shows his epididymis to be without masses.  A rectal exam shows his anus to be without masses.  His scrotum is without lesions.  His urethral meatus has no discharge.  His prostate has some BPH, but no nodularity.  His penis has no foreskin lesions.  His testes have no masses.  His seminal vesicles have no masses.  His sphincter tone is normal. 

  

An independent review of a urinalysis today is negative.  A review of clinical lab testes shows a nuclear matrix protein less than 10 on 11/14/87.  This was done via PCIS.  A post-void residual today is 14 cc.  

 

For his BPH, I believe he should continue with Cardura 2 mg p.o.  q.d.  His stone disease is quiescent, and he will let me know if there are any recurrences with symptoms of these.  We will consider checking a KUB in one year's time.  He will let me know if there are any difficulties in the interim.

	PERDUE MEDICAL CENTER
	


	Reason for visit:
   Follow up visit visit


	Interval History:
   60 year old man with Coronary artery disease who presented in November 2134 with substernal chest pressure and evidence of inferior ST-segment elevation.  Known risk factors at that time (in addition to his age and gender) were Hypertension and tobacco smoking.  Details of that presentation as per my 12/16/34 office note.

Emergent catheterization showed three areas of severe stenosis in the RCA territory, one in the ditsal RCA and two in the PLV.  The PLV lesions each received 2.5 x15mm Minivision (bare metal stents) and the distal RCA lesion received a 3.5 x15mm Vision (bare metal stent).  A non-dominant Left Circumflex had a 70% stenosis that was not intervened upon.  There was non-obstructive disease in the LAD.

A transthoracic echo showed an LV EF of 54% and no wall motion abnormalities.  Left atrium was slightly dilated to 39mm.  RV function was normal.

He recovered well and was discharged on an appropriate medical program (see below).  He had an outpatient ETT-MIBI to further evaluate the significance of the residual LCx disease.  He had this on 12/07/34 and he exercised for 6 minutes, 7 METS and achieved a heart rate 70% of predicted. He did not experience chest pain, had an appropriate increase in systolic blood pressure and the study was terminated due to leg fatigue.  The images showed inferior and apical thinning without ischemia.  LV EF 63%.

He had a recurrent episode of chest pain (somewhat different than his MI as it was not pressure like) and presented to the ED in March.  His ECG was stable and biomarkers were negative and he had a repeat ETT-MIBI in which he exercised for 7 mins 10 sec, achieving 9 METS, 80% MPHR, peak double product 19K.  A different type of chest pain occurrred during the study and was not study-limiting.  The ECG was negative for ischemia and the perfusion images were normal, without evidence of ischemia or infarction.  LV EF 68%.

He has overall done well since the time of his STEMI.  He completed part of the program at cardiac rehab.  He quit cigarette smoking at the time of the MI, and has remained abstinent since then.  He resumed normal activities without limiting symptoms in terms of chest pain or shortness of breath. His overall activity is at times limited due to ankylosing spondylitis and associated pain.

Three days ago he reports the onset of chest pain.  This occurs in his left chest and lasts hours at a time.  Not related to exertion and he has not tried SL TNG.  He states that he has been carrying heavy holiday packages and did some light outdoor work, and wonders if the pain may have been caused by those activities (i.e. muscolskeletal in nature).  He has 2 flights of stairs at home and is able to climb them with minimal shortness of breath, which has not changed since the onset of the CP.  He is unsure how the character relates to that of his previous MI, and he thinks it is similar to the discomfort he had in March that prompted his ED visit and negative stress test.  He denies lightheadedness or syncope.  No orthopnea or lower extremity swelling.

He continues to be compliant with his medical regimen.  He had a past sleep study which indicates the presence of sleep disordered breathing and he states he is in the process of acquiring home CPAP therapy.  He does report weight gain since stopping cigarettes.


	Past medical history:
   1) CAD status post inferior STEMI 11/34 with 3 bare metal stents to RCA territory (1 in distal RCA and two in the PLV).  Known residual LCx 70% lesion in a small, non-dominant vessel
2) Hypertension
3) Hyperlipideimia
4) Former smoker - quit at the time of his MI
5) Ankylosing spondylitis
6) Thrombophlebitis of the left leg, report of DVT in other notes

	

	Changes to Allergies
	
NKA: No Known Allergies - reaction: [reviewed]


	Medications (Confirmed):

	
ASA 
Lipitor  20mg po daily
lisinopril  10 mg po daily
Niaspan 
Plavix  75mg po daily
Toprol XL  25 mg PO daily

Physical examination:
	
-Pulse: 50  regular
-weight: 268  lbs.
-General:   Looks well, overweight, pleasant 
-HEENT:   Jugular venous pressure 7cm, carotids 2+ bilaterally without bruits
-Chest:   CTAB
-Cardiac:   Point of maximal impulse is midclavicular; Distant, regular, S1 and S2, no murmurs or rubs
-Abdomen:   Soft, obese, non-tender
-Extremities:   No lower extremity edema, 2+ posterior tibial pulses bilaterally
-BP: 130/75  both arms


	EKG:
   Baseline artifact, Sinus bradycardia at 50 bpm, clockwise rotation, minor nonspecific T wave changes; compared to 16-June-2135, the heart rate is slightly decreased, otherwise no important change.


	Assessment and plan:
   60 year old man with CAD status post inferior STEMI 11/34 treated with 3 bare metal stents to the RCA territory, Hypertension, Hyperlipidemia, and Ankylosing spondylitis who is overall doing well with secondary prevention efforts for his coronary disease, although he does report a chest pain syndrome for the past several days.

1) Coronary artery disease: Bare metal stents only are in place in the RCA territory, and he has now completed over a 12 month course of Plavix therapy.  Given that the main treatment plan at this time for his ankylosing spondylitis is NSAIDs (i.e. Motrin), he will stop Plavix to help minimize the bleeding risk and since there is no absolute indication for him to continue it at this point. 

He will continue the medical regimen of ASA 81mg daily, Lipitor 20mg daily, Toprol XL 25mg daily and Lisinopril 10mg daily.  His heart rate and blood pressure are well controlled.

The chest pain syndrome that he has been having for the past several days is reassuring in the sense that it is not exertion related and it seems similar to March when he had an ETT-MIBI without ischemia on perfusion images.  He does have a known 70% stenosis in a non-dominant LCx, but two imaging studies have not shown ischemia in that territory.  His ECG today is unchanged from priors.  However, given his history we will be vigilant for any change or persistence in symptoms.  I will call the patient in several days time, and if he continues to have symptoms he can have a repeat ETT.

2) Secondary prevention: Most recent Lipid panel in 10/35 on Lipitor 20mg daily shows TC 126, LDL 62, HDL 25 and TGs 195.  His LDL has been well controlled however his HDL has been very low on several readings.  Given this, along with an elevated TG value, we will start Niaspan.  He can start with 500 mg qhs for the first 2-3 weeks to help get through the common adverse effects (i.e. flushing).  He should take the medication with a glass of cold water and may take his daily aspirin 30 minutes before to help minimize side effects.  After a few weeks, he can increase to the maintenance dose of 1000 mg qhs.

He has quit smoking completely since the time of the MI and plans to continue this forward. He was encouraged to increase his physical activity level.

3) Hypertension: Reasonably well controlled on Toprol XL 25mg daily and Lisinopril 10mg daily.  He will be starting CPAP for sleep apnea soon which may have a favorable effect on his blood pressure.

IMPRESSION - 

1. ESRD
 - HD today 3 hrs (12/97 was undergoing 2.5 hr HD runs, but 9/97 was undergoing 3 hr runs; will measure URR and Kt/V), 2K/2.5Ca, 3L UF, no EPO, zemplar 1 mcg.  No heparin with HD given possible GI bleed.


2. ACCESS &#8211; During 8/97 admission, was to undergo fistulogram but per notes from last 9/97 admission AVF was functioning well.  Good thrill/bruit on exam. Place sign over bed indicating no BP's/IV's/blood draws from LUE.


3. ANEMIA &#8211; 
Hb currently high, but per ER notes had bloody stool overnight (per signout from current ER nurse and resident, no recurrence of hematochezia), has not had sufficient time to equilibrate.  Will hold EPO for now, would consider serial CBC's.  Consider GI consult given hematochezia, sigmoid c/rectal thickening on CT; distribution of colon involvement not in watershed area, but given extensive atherosclerotic disease, ischemic colitis possible in addition to infectious etiologies.




4. MINERALS &#8211; 
Phos at goal, on phoslo 1 tab po tidac.  PTH below goal, will give low dose zemplar 1 mcg IV.  VIt 25oh D low 8/27/97, may have already received course of ergo, will repeat levels and if &lt; 30, will need addtl course ergocalciferol.


5. VOLUME/HTN &#8211; 
Pt with elevated BP, volume up on exam; CT study also demonstrates pleural effusions, mild ascites, and diffuse soft tissue edema.  Pre-HD wt not obtained, will aim for 3L UF (EDW 48 kg).


6. NUTRITION &#8211; 
1.5L fluid restrict, 2g K restrict, continue nephrocaps.  Continue labetalol and lisinopril.


7. HEMATOCHEZIA - See #3.


8. LUNG OPACITY - Received vanc and cefepime for possible pna in ER prior to arrival on HD. Vanc not given on HD.  Would give addtl dose of cefepime 1 g today after HD.  Blood cx's x 2 drawn on HD.

LAU,HELEN M.   544-41-32-1              VISIT DATE: 10/17/96
PRESENTING COMPLAINT and HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  The 
patient is a 68-year-old female status post CABG in September of 
this past year.  She comes in with an acute headache this morning, 
followed by a syncopal event, which lasted approximately five 
seconds.  Currently, she is complaining of intermittent chest pain 
and a continuing headache across her head and down to her eyes. 
PAST MEDICAL and SURGICAL HISTORY:  The past history is notable for 
her CABG, as well as for a history of temporal arteritis. 
MEDICATIONS:  She was on prednisone, which was recently stopped. 
The rest of the PAST MEDICAL HISTORY, MEDICATIONS, and ALLERGIES: 
As documented in the written chart by the resident physician, and 
as reviewed by me. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination, she is an elderly 
black female in no acute distress.  She has a temperature of 100 
degrees F., a pulse of 90, and a blood pressure of 150/70.  The O2 
saturation is 97% on room air.  The examination is notable for a 
surgically altered pupil in the right eye, which is non-reactive. 
The extraocular movements are intact.  She has no palpable temporal 
or skull tenderness.  The lungs show rhonchorous breath sounds 
throughout.  The cardiovascular examination shows a midline scar, 
with a regular rate and rhythm and no murmur.  The abdomen is soft 
and non-tender.  The extremities show 1+ pitting edema bilaterally. 
The neurologic examination is grossly intact. 
THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  This is an elderly female status 
post recent CABG, who had a syncopal episode this morning after 
complaining of a headache.  The plan at this time is to obtain a 
head CT to rule out an intracerebral process.  She has had an EKG, 
which does show some T-wave changes, different from when she was 
here for her CABG.  She will also have cardiac enzymes sent and 
will be admitted to the hospital for further monitoring of her 
syncopal event. 
DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  As above.  The 
patient's condition on admission is stable.

Record date: 2102-12-01
ID: The patient is a 74 yr old woman with multiple medical problems, who comes in after recent 5 month hospitalization for followup and to review recent course of events.



HPI:  I had last seen her in 5/02 at which time her DM was being treated with Lantus 10 units, and Glucotrol XL 10 mg bid.  Her Lipitor had been held as had her Actos due to elevated LFT's, and her Depakote had been discontinued by her neurologist.  Her LFT's had come down from her hospitalization in March but were still elevated at AST 87 and ALT 124.  Liver biopsy was being considered by Dr. Yamasaki, her gastroenterologist.  She also had been recently hospitalized at San Rafael for syncope with history of partial seizure disorder vs TIA with history of transient episodes of right arm numbness and weakness dating to 2098 but with no seizures in 3 yrs.



In July O2 she had several episodes of syncope, one of which occured in her neurologist's office.    She was apparently hypotensive and initially refused to go to the ED, but later her family brought her to the ED at San Rafael.  She was found to be bacteremic with MRSA and was treated with IV vancomycin.   Endovascular sources were found to be negative as source, as was a knee tap, and no source was ever identified.  She was transferred to GCH in August.   She had severe back pain and two bone biopsies were negative for osteomyelitis in the spine.  She was also found to have a 50% compression fracture of T4 and this was treated at GCH with a T4 vertebroplasty in September 10.  She also was worked up for mets to spine but only benign hemangiomas were found.



She was discharged to rehab in mid September.  She required at least two more admissions from rehab to San Rafael over the next two months.  She apparently had severe gastroparesis and was unable to eat, requiring portacath for TPN around October 10.  She had then gone back to rehab again but was readmitted with DVT of the left Subclavian vein around the site of the Portacath.  She was started on Coumadin and was back in rehab for another few weeks.  The arm swelling quickly resolved. There was also reportedly a TIA which occured after an MRI scan with right facial droop and slurred speech at SRH.  She was finally discharged to home on November 21st.



MEDS:  Coumadin 7.5 mg qd,  Norvasc 10 mg qd, Isordil 20 mg tid, Neurontin 300 mg po bid, Plavix 75 mg po qd, Prilosec 20 mg qd, Folic aid 1 mg qd, Synthroid 50 mcg qd, Labetolol 200 mg bid, Glipizide 2.5 mg po qd, Albuterol inhaler prn, erytab 250 bid, Ultram 50 mg q 6hrs prn, MVI, Vitamin B12 1000. Rhinocort Aqua, Nitrostat prn,  Was d'cd from Reglan, taking Donperdon?



PE:  WDWN BF NAD  Wt 135 lbs  BP 100/64



Heent:  throat clear,  EOMI. Perrl.

Neck:  supple without adenopathy or thyromegaly.

Cor:  RRR, no m's.

Lungs; clear.

Abdomen;  soft, nontender no HSM.

Extr;  no edema.



A/P:  74 yr old woman with multiple medical problems, s/p 5 month hospitalization.



1)  Diabetes.  Throughout her hospitalization she lost a lot of weight down from 160's to 170's last spring to current level of 135 lbs.  Insulin was stopped and just recently Glipizide 2.5 mg added on.  Recent Hg A1C obtained after this visit on 12/04/02 was 6.0.  Bun /Cr was 11/0.9.  glucose 196.  Cholesterol 225/68/135.  LFT's were not done and need to be done, will be ordered next lab draw.  If normalized then will add back Lipitor.  History of gastroparesis, on new med has replaced Reglan, doing better.



2)  Hypertension.  Doing well on Norvasc 10, Labetolol 200 bid and Isordil 20 tid.



3)  S/p recent upper extremity DVT, on coumadin.  Per Dr. Herbert Paris's note of 12/02, she needs 3 months of anticoag, and then 1mg/day until the portacath discontinued.  With history 2 prior DVT's will need to discuss whether she should be on long term therapy.  She is now getting FS INR's thru the VNA, but will be transitioned to Internal Medicine, with access thru the portacath, or continued FS's.  INR has been in good range with 7.5 mg coumadin.



4)  S/P  compression fracture of T4, s/p vertebroplasty with successful resolution of the pain.  Has other compression fractures but not interested in further procedures at this time.



5)  History of hypothyroidism.  Had recent labs at SRH on  12/04/02 with TSH of 1.3 and Free T4 of  0.9.  



6)  History of anemia, requiring Procrit and ? transfusions during her hospitalizations, with normal hct of 41.1 on  12/04/02.



7)  Neuro;  History of partial seizures, TIA's.  Followed by Dr. Gary Keyes.    History of silent cerebellar brain infarction on MRI.    History of moderate intracranial carotid stenosis, with recent ? TIA left hemisphere, ? repeat carotid noninvasives per Dr. Keyes vs CT angiogram.  On Plavix and coumadin.  Per Dr. Keyes coumadin alone would be enough for stroke prophylaxis, and he would defer to Dr. Barry as to whether to continue Plavix.



8)  History of elevated LFT's.  May have been medication related, due to Lipitor, Actos, Depakote.  Now off all meds, need redo as above, and consideration if normal of retrial of  statin.

KIM,DOUGLAS JR   201-63-51-2                VISIT DATE: 04/03/95

The patient was seen primarily by me. 

PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  Fall, right knee injury.

HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  Mr. Killian is a very pleasant 

54-year-old gentleman, with a history of diabetes, who had a fall 

on December 18, 2094.  At the time, he sustained an injury to his 

right knee which healed and then began to break down, and he 

developed a large wound which began draining and had foul odor.  

The patient had continued difficulty ambulating and presented to 

the emergency department for evaluation.  The patient denies having 

any hardware in his knee.  No history of osteomyelitis.  No 

hardware.  No history of peripheral neuropathy.  

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Patient denies any fevers or chills.  No nausea 

or vomiting.  No abdominal pain.  No chest pain or shortness of 

breath.  Patient is only complaining of difficulty ambulating 

secondary to the pain.   

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Two patellar tendon repairs at EDUCARE-PULLMAN in 2083, 

repair of a patellar fracture.  Recent diagnosis of diabetes, 

atrial fibrillation.  Hypertension, high cholesterol, and positive 

PPD.  

MEDICATIONS:  Please see nurses note for list of medications. 

ALLERGIES:  PENICILLIN (rash). 

SOCIAL HISTORY AND FAMILY HISTORY:  The patient is a smoker.  He 

does not drink alcohol.  He works in engineering, and lives alone. 

Family history is noncontributory. 

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  GENERAL:  Patient is awake, alert, talking 

in full sentences, in mild distress secondary to pain.  VITAL 

SIGNS:  Afebrile, temperature 99.3, respiratory rate 20, blood 

pressure 161/96, pulse 95.  HEAD:  Atraumatic.  NECK:  Supple.  

LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation.  No wheezes, rales or rhonchi.  

HEART:  Regular rate.  No murmurs, gallops or rubs.  ABDOMEN:  

Soft, nontender.  SKIN:  A large ulcer to the right knee, right 

over the patella, with significant amount of break-down necrotic 

tissue and purulent discharge with a foul odor.  The depth of the 

wound is difficult to assess.  Intact motor function and sensation. 

Full flexion and extension of the knee, and evidence of well-healed 

midline scar above the ulcer.  NEURO:  Intact with good pulses 

palpable throughout.  

LABORATORY EVALUATION:  Plain film of the right knee, CT of the 

right knee, and laboratory values done.  Laboratory values 

demonstrated a white count of 14, ESR of 13, ESRP of 2.1.  Rest of 

the labs were normal except for an elevated glucose to 226.  Film 

of the knee shows patellofemoral arthritis with no evidence of 

osteomyelitis, no hardware seen.  CT of the knee showed a 

superficial ulcer to the depth of the patellar tendon but the 

patellar tendon itself was intact.  

THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  The patient was initially seen by 

orthopedic who felt that the ulcer was over the patellar tendon, at 

the site of prior surgeries, with no effusion or joint pain, and 

normal range of motion with joint involvement unlikely.  We are all 

very hesitant to tap this knee and it will not be done at this time 

for fear of introducing infection into the joint.  The patient is 

awaiting consultation by general surgery for probable admission and 

debridement in the operating room.  The plan at this time was to 

hold off on antibiotics.  Blood cultures were sent.  The patient is 

receiving IV fluids. 

CONSULTATIONS (including PCP):  Orthopedics, general surgery.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  Knee ulcer.

DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  The patient was 

admitted and transitioned to ED Obs, awaiting evaluation by the 

surgical service for probable admission.  The patient is currently 

in stable and satisfactory condition, in Obs awaiting surgery 

evaluation.

NMH GU

Donn Emery
NMH#:  059-57-26

December 29, 2096

INTERVAL HISTORY:

He has been troubled by increasing shortness of breath, which Dr. Pina, the physician covering for Dr. Park, thought might be related to asbestosis.  He is to see her next on January 15, 2097. 

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:

General:  Complaint of mild fatigue.  No fevers, chills, or change in appetite.
HEENT:  No blurred vision, oral ulcers, lesions, thrush, neck swelling, neck stiffness, hoarseness.
Pulmonary:  No cough, SOB, DOE, hemoptysis, wheezing. 
Cardiac:  No chest pain, palpitations.
Gastrointestinal:  No nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, or abdominal pain.  
Urologic:  No dysuria, hematuria.
Lymph Nodes:  No enlarged lymph nodes.
Musculoskeletal:  No back pain, neck pain, leg pain, or arm pain.
Hematologic:  No bruising, bleeding or clotting.
Neurologic:  The neuropathy has become much worse, the left hand worse than the right.  He said that Dr. Pina thought that was likely secondary to his diabetes and made some changes in his medications.  He has had some moderately severe back pain.  

REVIEW OF STUDIES:

Blood studies on November 14, 2096 were satisfactory except for a BUN of 41 with a creatinine of 1.3.  I assume that that will be part of the checking up, which Dr. Pina will be doing.  A chest CT scan on December 22, 2096 showed no change in the small mediastinal nodes, but I will plan, just to be sure, to do a chest CT scan and an abdominal CT scan in six months.  If those studies are stable and satisfactory, I discussed with Mr. Emery the fact that I may not do scans subsequently given the absence of activity of lymphoma, the importance of his other medical conditions, and his advancing age.  

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  

Weight:  175 lb. with shoes.
Blood Pressure:  I did not record a blood pressure, as it was above 160 and because of difficulties getting an accurate reading with a digital machine.  He is to have this checked by Dr. Pina.  
Skin:  Normal.
Lymph Nodes:  There was no cervical, axillary, or inguinal lymphadenopathy.  There is an abnormality in the medial left supraclavicular fossa unchanged from several previous examinations.
Lungs:  Clear. 
Heart:  Normal.
Abdomen:  No masses or tenderness.
Extremities:  No evidence of DVT.  No edema.
Rectal Exam:  On rectal exam, the prostate was small, without abnormalities. 

IMPRESSION:  

He is having considerable difficulties, which relate both to physical issues described above and the fact that he is living alone.  His wife is in a care facility, which cares for individuals with Alzheimer s disease and this also has taken its toll on him overall.

I will see him next in six months.

			CARDIOLOGY

			

			TRUMBULL MEMORIAL HOSPITAL

			



			Reason for visit:

   Second opinion regarding painful legs with walking at less than 50 yards and also balance disorder.



			Interval History:

   Mr.  Xavier Olive is a 73-year-old gentleman who comes into Trumbull Memorial Vascular Center for a second opinion regarding his lower extremity discomfort and also his progressive difficulty walking and maintaining balance.  His referring physician is Dr.  Ximena Keane, practicing out of Alexandria Clinic.  Mr.  Olive also heard about the TMH VC through TV advertisements.  



He is 73 years old, has history of diabetes starting in 2135, known history of peripheral artery disease with claudication and calf discomfort, for which he has previously seen Dr.  Cain at Alexandria Clinic, and also has been evaluated and treated at the Corcoran District Hospital.  Specifically, he describes having been evaluated by Dr.  Cain and others some three or four years ago, and undergoing at least two procedures, all related to his legs cramping up.  He received prior stenting to his right common iliac artery and his left superficial femoral artery, so far as I can tell.  The stents were placed at Pomeroy Care Center (Big Rapids, AC) and also he had evaluation at the Corcoran District Hospital, and may have had a stenting procedure or revascularization procedure there.  The patient and his wife are somewhat unclear about the dates and locations and times, but he does state that the treatments apparently did not help him at all.  Currently, he has discomfort in both calves when he walks too far or too fast, and this stops him at about 50 yards.  



The issue was complicated by the fact that he has had progressive parkinsonian-type symptoms, walking in a shuffle, tipping forward, and occasionally even falling forward and losing his balance completely.  His legs are rubbery, and he does even realize that he is falling forward when it happens.  It is worse when he is carrying things that weigh anything.  At the same time, his calves do cramp up in a typical fashion consistent with claudication, and he has known peripheral artery disease.  Also feels though his hips sometimes are cramping up.  The patient feels quite disabled by his symptoms, especially as a gentleman who was active and never had physical problems of this nature.  Again, there is some degree of blurring between the parkinsonian symptoms and his claudication, as to which is truly causing his disability.



			Past medical history:

   Diabetes, onset in 2135.  

Parkinsonian-type movement disorder, followed by Dr.  Jeffers and Innis, and for which he was placed on Sinemet, presuming it was due to Parkinson's.  The patient has not improved despite trying the medications.  MRI at AC starting in 2153 has shown apparent central and peripheral atrophy, unchanged.  

Status post vertebrobasilar TIA by report.  

Neuropathy, documented by EMG in 2151 with no spinal stenosis by MRI.  

Cervical spondylosis.  

Tracheal tumor resection in 2128 performed via a suprasternal incision.  

Hypertension.  

Mild renal artery stenosis documented by arteriography in 2153 during one of his peripheral angiograms.

  lisinopril 2.5 mg QD

 glyburide 2.5 mg QD

 cilostazol 100 mg BID

 terazosin 4 mg QD

			Social history:

   He is retried Motor Vehicle Body Repairer.  He used to work at GM.  He lives with his wife, who comes in today with him.  He has three children.  Nondrinker.  He smoked until 30 years ago.



			Review of systems:

   Detailed review of systems was carried out.  It was also reviewed on the patient questionnaire sheet that the patient brought with him.  He does claim to have some dyspnea with exertion as well as intermittent indigestion consistent with GERD.  He has nocturia.  He wears dentures.  No significant weight loss or anorexia.  No visual changes or other neurologic symptoms other than the gait disturbance and neuropathy.  He denies chest discomfort or anything to suggest cardiac ischemia.  Otherwise, review of systems is negative in detail.



Physical examination:

			

-Pulse:   68 and regular.  Afebrile

-BP: 105/55    , obtained by myself.  Equal bilaterally

-General:   Well-developed male in no distress, appears his stated age.  Slightly stooped over, and has a parkinsonian-type affect and appearance

-Skin:   Without rashes

-Heent:   Normal facies, or slightly masked, with normal extraocular motions and reactive pupils

-Neck:   Carotid upstrokes are normal, no bruits.  No JVD

-Chest:   Clear

-Cardiac:   Discloses normal S1 and S2, no S3 or S4, and no murmurs

-Abdomen:   Moderately obese, protuberant, soft, and nontender.  Good bowel sounds, no organomegaly, no enlargement of the aorta.  May be a soft bruit in the midline to deep auscultation

-Extremities:   Femoral pulses are 2+ bilaterally, with soft bruits on both sides.  Below this, no cyanosis or edema (perhaps trace to 1+ edema), and posterior tibial pulses are 1 to 2+.  Dorsalis pedis pulses are not easily palpable.  Good capillary refill

-Neuro:   Gait is disturbed, with slight shuffling and slightly stooped.  His strength is normal, and sensory findings are slightly abnormal with diminished sensation in a stocking-glove distribution.  He does not have any cogwheeling to my examination.  Otherwise, no focal deficits



Procedures:

			

Free text procedures  Exercise ABIs-resting ABI is normal on the right and left at 0.  92 and 1.03, respectively.  The toe brachial index drops to 0.29 on the right side and 0.91 at 1 minute after exercise.  I am not sure what to make of these ABIs since it appears that the actual ankle-brachial indices were not measured following exercise.



			EKG:

    demonstrates normal sinus rhythm or sinus bradycardia at heart rate of 55.  There is normal axis and intervals, with no evidence of prior infraction, and perhaps a slight right ventricular conduction delay.



			Other Data:

   DOB: 11/25/2083.



			Assessment and plan:

   Lower extremity arterial disease (PAD)-the patient clearly has history of PAD with prior interventions on both sides.  Currently, complains of symptoms that sound like claudication, predominantly involving the calves on both sides, right slightly ahead of the left, and I would not be surprised if he has significant focal obstructive disease along the length of his iliac of SFA.  Since his ABIs are well preserved at rest, I suspect he does not have pre-occlusion of the SFA, for example.  On the other hand, he does have diabetes and his ABIs may be falsely elevated.  



His major limitation is due to a combination of the claudication that occurs less than 50 yards and stops him at that point, and the gait disturbance that he has related to his movement disorder, possible Parkinson's disease.  I am not sure that this latter entity has been well enough defined, and I would suggest that we have him see a neurologist here to better ascertain the nature of that disease, and as to whether there is anything better available in the way of treatment.  



1.  As far his peripheral artery disease, it would be extremely helpful to obtain films from AC and/or the CDH, to better define what procedures were actually performed and where stents were placed.  Given that it has been a year or more since his last intervention, it is likely he will need another angiographic study (or MRA/CTA) in order to ascertain the nature of his disease.  



2.  Neurologic disorder-we will refer to a neurologist.  



PLAN: 

1.  Formal exercise ABIs.  

2.  Obtain angiographic studies from AC.  

3.  Followup visit in one month.  

4.  Appointment with Dr.  Ruiz.

	Reason for visit:
    s/p cath


	Interval History:
   Per HPI J. Jordan Duran:

64 y.o. male with known CAD. He has multiple risk factors and a cardiac history dating back to December 2095. At that time he was experiencing exertional chest pressure while shoveling. He initially attributed his symptoms to GERD; however the chest pressure began to occur post prandially and nocturnally. He was admitted at SCH where his ECG revealed non-specific ST T wave abnormalities and he had negative enzymes. 

He was then transferred to WPH where cardiac catheterization revealed a 90% LAD lesion, a 70% OM1 lesion, a 70% 3rd OM and an 85% RCA. His ejection fraction at that time was 40%. He was referred for surgery. He underwent a successful CABG x 5 with a LIMA to the LAD, a sequential SVG to the Acute Marginal and PDA, and a sequential SVG to the 1rst Diagonal and OM1. 

He now presents with recurrent chest burning. He states that it is similar in nature to his symptoms prior to CABG. His chest burning is exertional and is relieved with rest. He denies dyspnea, nausea, vomiting, dizziness and diaphoresis. During a follow up appointment at SCH, he was referred for a stress test. Per Bruce Protocol he exercised 6 minutes and 0 seconds. He states that his chest burning symptoms returned and were lessened with SL TNG, though not completely resolved. MIBI images reveal severe large perfusion defect extending from the septum to apex with reversibility. There is also a fixed basal infero-lateral territory consistent with infarct. His ejection fraction is 46%. He was admitted for cardiac catheterization done today with full report pending. Reportedly RCA diffuse, SVG-PDA patent, SVg-Dx1-OM patentw/ mod. ostial stenosis, LIMA-LAD 100%, LM mild, LAD severe w/ distal 100%, LCx OM 100%. Plan is for med management.

Name:	Olive, Xavier		

MRN: 26690002



Mr. Olive was seen with Dr. Innis in general neurology clinic on 07/11/55.   Dr. Innis was present for or performed all salient aspects of the history and physical exam and together we discussed with the patient the work-up and treatment plan. 



Return visit.

Mr. Olive is a 71y old RHM, with Idiopathic Parkinson's disease. He was started on Sinemet 25/100mg tid with significant improvement in his balance & gait & rest tremor. However there were still periods of shuffling & stumbling especially going down slope. He also complained of persistant fatigue in his legs. We started him on Amantadine 100mg tid during his last visit. He did not tolerate it well & complained of dizziness especially when he goes out, even with reduced dose of 100mg bid. He has discontinued it since then.

He is tolerating Sinemet well, no hallucinations, on-off phenomenon. He does not notice any wearing off of the effect prior to next dose. No dyskinesias.

No new Neurological symptoms. He still has poor balance but his posture is much improved.

Gibson Internal Medicine Intern Admission Note

PATIENT:  Grace Marvin Yandell
MRN:  8099832
ADMIT DATE:  8/27/02
PCP:  unknown

CC:  tx from Mount San Rafael Hospital

HPI:  80F with multiple medical problems including breast ca s/p R. breast lumpectomy, chemotherapy and radiation treatment 30 years ago, recurrent syncope, and seizure disorder who was admitted to San Rafael Mount Hospital following a syncopal event at her neurologist   s office on 7/30/02.  At that time, she c/o dizziness, nausea, and her bp reportedly decreased to 60/40.   As per pt   s family, she initially refused to go to the ED but in the car on the way home became increasingly confused, dizzy, and nauseas and was brought to Rafael Mount ED.

Five weeks ago     prior to her hospital admission - pt   s family reports that during a vacation pt had one episode of seizure like activity for which she was seen in Massachusetts and declared stable and released and a second unwitnessed collapse in alaska where she was brought to a hospital in Anchorage and treated for dehydration.  Upon return from vacation, and daughter recalls that she had cough and cold sxs at the time, c/o increasing weakness, backpain, and fevers.  During the same time, the patient reports that she was being weaned off her seizure medications and other medications that might adversely affect her LFTs secondary to LFT elevation on laboratory exams.

At present, pt. c/o severe(10/10) upper back pain and mid-sternal CP (8/10) that seems fixed to her back pain improved with pain medications and worse with movement.  She reports that she is short of breath all the time and has been coughing a thick mucous.  

Hospital Course: 
MRSA Bacteremia:  Blood cultures at San Rafael Hospital grew S. aureus and pt. was started on IV vancomycin.  The bacteremic source remains unclear.  TTE on 8/01/02 showed an EF of 60-65%, no evidence of endocarditis reported.  A TEE on 8/7/02 visualezed all the valves and no vegetations were seen.  Her R. knee was tapped on 8/8/02 and cultures were negative.  A bone scan on 7/7/02 showed a metastatic lesion on MRI in the lower thoracic region  and focal increased uptake in the lateral tibial plateau o f R. knee.
Back pain: Pt. c/o moderately severe back pain throughout hospital stay at MSRH.  Thoracic spine xrays on 7/31/02 showed osteopenia with no acute fracture or subluxation.  An MRI of thoracic spin (8/02/02) showed a marrow replacing process in the L. T10 pedicle and another smaller lesion at the L. inferior aspect of T11.  The lesion was suspicious for metastatic disease.  No epidural extension was noted.  There was a patent spinal canal and lack of impingement on the thoracic cord.  Pt. received dilaudid 1-3 mg q4hours prn back pain.  As per psych notes, she did not wish to change medications to methadone or fentanyl.  A CT guided bx of the thoracic spine took place on 8/15/02 and was non-diagnostic.  A neurosurgery consult reported that an open bx might destabilize her given the locationo f the pedicle and recommended that the biopsy be done at GCH.    A repeat MRI was done on 8/20/02 due to increasing c/o back pain and showed a 50% compression fx of T4, persitent abnl marrow signal in L. pedicle of T11, and overall heterogenous marrow signal pattern throughout the visualized vertebral bodies.  Immunoelectrophoresis was ordered to r/o myeloma.  
Right Breast Mass:  A firm R. breast mass was noted at the 7 o/clock position of R. breast at site of lumpectomy scar and the thickening was thought to be 2/2 to previous sx by surgeous at OSH.  A mammogram on 8/5/02 showed innumerable benign appearing calcifications in both breasts.  The R. Breast was significantly smaller and a heterogeneously dense parenchymal pattern was identified.  An u/s of R. breast showed no discrete mass.  A biopsy was delayed 2/2 to bacteremia.  
Renal failure:  Pt. developed renal failure while on vancomycin with an increase of cr from 1.1 to 2.4.  Her vancomycin level was noted to be >60 on 8/13/02 and vanco was discontinued.  Repeat blood cultures were negative for S. aureus.  
Anemia: On admission to Rafael Hospital, Hb/Hct: 11.6/35.5.  She was started on procrit by hematology.  She was transfused on unit of PRBCs in the hospital.
TIA:  Pt. has a hx of TIAs with one episode while hospitalized significant for difficulty with speech and R. hand tingling.  An MRI that day showed new increased signal w/in the ventricles and subarachnoid space noted diffusely.  This finding was likely due to prior IV contrast administration of gadolinium, though an underlying hemorrhage or infection could not be excluded.  A brain MRI on 8/18/02 showed resolution of abnl signal w/in the ventricles, decrease in  high signal in the subarachnoid space, likely representing resolution of sequelae from prior IV gadolinium.  No findings of meningitis but persisting increased signal w/in the L. lope, which may represent vitreal hemorrhage.  
HTN: Pt. required adjustments in her meciations during her hospital stay to control hypertension.


MEDICAL HISTORY
Recurrent syncope: 2086-2100, 3-4 events per year, last event prior to hospitalization
Seizure disorder: first sz in 2090s with unresponsive, staring, mouth movements; often occurred in clusters once a year, last sz prior to admission.

LABS PENDING

ASSESSMENT & PLAN
80F with multiple medical problems including breast ca s/p R. breast lumpectomy, chemotherapy and radiation treatment 30 years ago, recurrent syncope, and seizure disorder who was admitted to San Rafael Hospital following a syncopal event on 7/30/02.  Found to have a MRSA bacteremia with an unidentified source, lesions at T10/T11 on spinal MRI, and continued c/o back pain and nausea.

Back pain: MRI of T spine with abnl and prior percutaneous bx non-diagnostic.  Differential dx includes metastatic disease vs. infection.  Neurosurgery  consulted at San Rafael who felt it to be a high risk procedure and tx here for further mngmt.  MRI read at MSRH indicated that lesion was more consistent with malignancy than infection.
-re-read of OSH studies by radiologists at GCH
-IR guided bone bx as per IR
-neurosurgery if IR unable to biopsy
-dilaudid 1-3 mg IV q4hours, reglan and zofran prn nausea
-consider pain consult

2.    ID:  Staph bacteremia at OSH, TTE and TEE showed no vegetations indicating that endocarditis is not the source, R. knee aspiration also negative.   Pt. has now completed 4 weeks antibiotics with renal failure during course of vancomycin.
d/c vancomycin
con to monitor fever curve
if osteomyelitis found on bx, will need further course of antibiotics
blood cx x2 now, and reculture if febrile
ongoing nausea and vomiting: consider non contrast head CT to r/o septic emboli, pt has had multiple MRIs at OSH
held erythromycin 250 mg PO bid, pt reportedly takes it as prophylaxis for R. arm cellulites, consider restarting
heart murmur heard on PE, not documented in prior notes; consider re-echoing pt here

Breast mass: As per San Rafael, mass on R. breast is likely due to thickening s/p lumpectomy thirty years ago.  A mammogram on 8/5/02 showed innumerable benign appearing calcifications in both breasts.  The R. Breast was significantly smaller and a heterogeneously dense parenchymal pattern was identified.  An u/s of R. breast showed no discrete mass.  A biopsy was delayed 2/2 to bacteremia.  
-consider biopsy of R. breast mass now that bacteremia resolved

Renal:  s/p acute renal failure while on vancomycin, recheck creatinine and hold vanco for now
-f/u creatinine

HTN: At San Rafael, bp medications adjusted.  Restarted on same medications here.  
-cont to monitor
-adjust as needed


FEN: soft mechanical diet


PROPHYLAXIS
GI: none, consider nexium
DVT: heparin 5000 units sc tid

Comprehensive evaluation of all problems.



Problems	  

hypertension	      

PRESENT SINCE MID 2060'S. FOLLOWED BY DR. THACKER AT DARDANELLE HOSPITAL. 

	ETT 5/12/82 TO 98% PRMHR SHOWED ST CHANGES WHICH WERE SUGGESTIVE BUT NOT DIAGNOSTIC AND THERE WAS BASELINE LVH WITH STRAIN BUT THALLIUM WAS NEG. THERE WERE OCCASIONAL PVC'S AND COUPLETS AND TWO 3 BEAT RUNS OF VT.     HAD BEEN ACCEPTABLE ALBEIT ON AN ELABORATE REGIMEN THAT HAD EVOLVED. SUBOPTIMAL WITH ADDITIONAL WEIGHT GAIN 5/23/86. WILL RECHECK 6-8 WEEKS AFTER 8-10 LB WEIGHT LOSS. ETT THAL SCHEDULED, GIVEN ABNL ECG, RISK FACTORS, AND HIS CONTINUING DESIRE TO EXERCISE. 

	5/86 EXCELLENT EXERCISE CAPACITY TO 9 METS, ECG NONDIAGNOSTIC DUE TO BASELINE ABNORMALITIES BUT THALLIUM NL.     

	150/74 7/86 AND WILL ACCEPT THIS FOR NOW BUT STILL NEEDS TO LOSE WEIGHT. 

	140/78 9/86 WO WEIGHT LOSS. REDISCUSSED IT WOULD MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO SIMPLIFY HIS REGIMEN CONSIDERABLY. HE REMAINS ON VERY ELABORATE REGIMEN THAT HE HAD BEEN ON FOR YEARS BY DR. TITUS.   (8/8/87)
[28-Aug-2088]
	REASONABLE CONTROL ON REGIMEN, BUT STILL NEEDS WEIGHT LOSS.  78-9 really not adequate control with his mild diabetes; increased Cardura to 8 mg without help.  Change Procardia XL to Norvasc with increase from 15 to 20 mg.  BP control acceptable. 

	7/91 still a bit suboptima and Lisinopril increased from 40mg to 60mg per day.  Continue to emphasize weight loss.  

hyperglycemia	      

BS WAS APPARENTLY 190 FASTING 2/82 BUT THEN LOST 10 LBS. 3 HR PC BS IS 91 3/3/82. RBS 118 AND HBA1C 5.06 = 83 4/22/83. 121 4/84.

FBS 154 AND HBA1C 6.44 = 129 ON 4/87, DONE BY HPLC METHODS SINCE THERE HAD BEEN A DISCREPANCY BETWEEN BLOOD SUGARS AND HBA1C LEVELS, AND THIS WAS IN AGREEMENT WITH RESULT BY AFFINITY. DISCUSSED DIETARY CHANGE AT LENGTH. 8/87 VISIT.  (8/8/87)  A1C 6.10 = 117.  BLOOD SUGARS BECAME HIGHER, HE DID EXCEPT NUTRITION REFERRAL, BEGUN ON METFORMIN 500 BID WITH GI SXS WHEN 3RD DOSE ADDED.  5/88 A1C 7.04 = 149.  AT THAT POINT HAD LOST 14 POUNDS.  [28-Aug-2088]
	STARTED ON METFORMIN WITH A1C NORMAL AT 500 BID.  1/90 A1C 6.60.  Urine microalbumin is high and this was discussed.  Already on good dose ACEI and try to control BP.   Gets regular eye exams. 4/91 A1C 6.00 on Metformin 500mg tid.  FBS and A1C done.  

Spell	      

4/4/90 at Gym while lying down with his head back, he had dizziness and then weakness.  Seen in Educare-Pullman ER with vital signs and sugar fine.  ECG unchanged and not reproducible.  Turns out he's had similar sxs for about 30 years, always with his head back.  TCDs here okay except ? of middle cerebral artery, resolved with spinal CT angio.  

	7/91 no further episodes.

gout	      

HAS HAD VARIOUS ACUTE JOINT SWELLINGS, INCL ELBOW AND ANKLE. APPARENTLY  DX OF GOUT WAS MADE. HE HAS NOTED THIS OCCURS ESPECIALLY IF HE EATS LOTS OF CHOCOLATE, WHICH HE TENDS TO DO FREQUENTLY. LAST EPISODE WAS ABT A YR AGO. NO HO UROLITHIASIS. DISCUSSED POSSIBLE ROLE OF FUROSEMIDE, AND SINCE IT IS NOT ENTIRELY CLR TO ME WHY HE NEEDS TO BE ON A HIGH DOSE OF FUROSEMIDE IT MAY BE POSSIBLE FOR THIS TO BE ADJUSTED. HOWEVER, NO FURTHER EPISODES.  UNTIL POSTOP 3/86 ATTACK.  HAVE REDUCED FUROSEMIDE.  SPRING 2088 HAVING SOME MILD SXS THAT COULD BE PODAGRA AND SOME ANKLE SXS, THOUGH W/O OVERT INFLAMMATION.  WONDER WHETHER LEFT OLECRANON  COULD BE TOPHUS.  HIS RIGHT FOURTH TOE ALSO HAS A LONGSTANDING DEFORMITY WHICH IS NOT TYPICAL FOR TOPHUS BUT COULD BE.  URIC ACID 7.8 1/88. URIC ACID DONE TODAY.  STARTED ON 0.6 COLCHICINE DAILY.  IF URIC ACID HIGH WILL START ON LOW DOSE ALLOPURINOL IN VIEW OF PHOSPHO-TOPHI.  [28-Aug-2088]

The patient is a 67-year-old man with hypertension, diabetes, and 
history of recent stroke who comes in for follow up and for 
evaluation of positive PPD.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  He was being evaluated for day 
program and in the course of this had a PPD placed which was 
positive.  He has no history of prior TB testing.  He has had no 
chest pain, shortness of breath, cough, fever, chills, weight 
loss or night sweats.  He has had no known exposure to TB.  

He is being treated for hypertension which has been difficult to 
control but seems recently to be doing quite well on a 
combination of HCTZ 12.5mg, metoprolol 50mg b.i.d., Norvasc 10mg 
PO q.d., Zestril 20mg PO q.d.  Today's blood pressure was 
terrific at 128/70.  

He has diabetes and his hemoglobin A1C came down from 10.4 in 
February to 7.9 in May.  He had been started in February on 
Glucophage 500mg PO b.i.d. and seems to e tolerating it quite 
well.  

He did have a stroke in August 2091 with right-sided hemiparesis.  
He is able to walk to the bathroom with a cane but otherwise uses 
a wheelchair.  He had a form for me to complete for a day program 
listing his typical functioning.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  He is a well-developed, well-nourished, 
pleasant man.  Weight was not done.  Blood pressure 128/70.  
HEENT: throat clear.  Neck supple, no adenopathy or thyromegaly.  
No carotid bruits.  No JVD.  Heart: no murmurs.  Lungs are clear.  
Extremities: no edema.  Neuro: he has weakness in the right leg 
and arm. 

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
1. 	Positive PPD.  At the time of this dictation, his chest x-ray 
came back and is completely normal.  Given his age and unknown 
duration of his positive PPD, will not treat.  
2. 	Hypertension.  Doing well on current combination of 
medications.
3. 	Diabetes, doing much better since he started Glucophage.  At 
his next visit, I will need to confirm when his last eye 
appointment was.  
4. 	Status post CVA.  He seems to be functioning well.

Chief Complaint	

Admission note- Internal Medicine

Kenneth Weeks- 1205466





History of Present Illness	

Mr. Weeks is a 78 yr. old male who was admitted for further cardiac testing.



His PMH includes hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation and mitral regurgitation.  He has been experiencing increasing dyspnea with exertion over the past 5 weeks.  He has especially noted this when he climbs stairs or walking up an incline.  He also notes this SOB when he is walking the golf course. He denies any chest pain or orthopnea, although he states that he has been experiencing some ""indigestion"" the past few days.  It usually occurs in the morning. He was given sublingual nitroglycerin and notes improvement in his symptoms  His Lasix dose was increased on 4/3/96 (from 80 mg to 120 mg).  This increase did help his symptoms a little, but he still felt his exercise capacity had decreased.  



An ECHO was done on 4/10 which was not significantly changed from 1/95.  His EF was 74%, mild MR, dilated LA, symmetric LV hypertrophy without any obvious segmental wall motion abnormalities and RVSP 43 mmHg.  



A Sestamibi stress test was done on 5/19.  The patient exercised for 3 minutes 21 seconds reaching 84% of predicted HR.  His EKG had STD AVF, V4-V6.  The perfusion scans showed a moderate, reversible mid-distal anterior, septal and apical defect indicative of moderate ischemia.  LV function preserved.



He was admitted electively today for further evaluation. He arrives to Internal Medicine chest pain free and hemodynamically stable.

Chief Complaint	

Mrs Chapman  is here today to follow up on HTN, DM 



History of Present Illness	

I saw her 2/24/87 for HTN and DM. BP was high and increased Lisinopril to 20 mg QD

Restarted Lipitpr but she still is not taking it. The pharmacy didn't give it to her. Her LDL is 116 ono 2/87 and has DM, goal <100.

Feels well. 

Had an ETT MIBI few weeks ago and no evidence of ischemia.

Denies CP, SOB, palpitations

Started walking daily around Woodstown about 3.5 miles and has lost 7 pounds since I saw her. Also eating more vegetables and fruits and less carbohydrates.



Third, she had a renal U/S done for hematuria and showed small left renal mass. Had a CT scan later that showed the same and recommended an MRI. She had it done few 9/86. Recommended to repeat it soon. Left lower pole renal lesion with MRI signal characteristics consistent with a cystic, septated, unenhancing renal lesion or bosniak grade 2. However, when compared to prior CT examination demonstrating late filling of this lesion, follow up is warranted to exclude a cystic renal neoplasm making this an overall bosniak grade 2F. 





Review of Systems	

C/P: Denies PND, orthopnea. Leg swelling after walking around the pond

General: Denies fever, chills

HEENT : No cold sx

Ms. Stevens is a 64 year old lady with ESRD admitted with hypertension and nausea as well as vomiting. She was quite hypertensive and I would wonder about the effect of BP. She also looks fluid overloaded.


PLAN:


HD x 3 1/4 hours, 2 K, 2.5 Ca
Negative 3 liters
Needs Medication clarification and good BP control.

RE: TRENT, SHIRLEY
LCC #99210914
02/22/2096


Xitlalic Pearson, M.D.
Martha Washington Hospital
617 Comanche Street
Milbank, MN 49757   


Dear Dr. Pearson: 

I had the pleasure of seeing Mrs. Shirley Trent in follow up this morning. Mrs. Trent is a 71 year-old right-handed woman with a history of a left corona radiata stroke in December 2094 complicated by a dense right hemiparesis. She presented today with her granddaughter, Ms. Carey Trent. Ms. Trent translated and provided supplemental interval history.

Interval History
Mrs. Trent moved to the Eddie Bauer Nursing home approximately one month ago. She has continued to have a dense paresis of the right arm and leg, which has confined her to a wheelchair. She has had spasticity, in particular of the right leg, that has been painful at times and has contributed to sleeping difficulties. Baclofen was initiated and titrated to 20 mg TID, with some efficacy. According to Carey, another medication may have been used around the turn of the year. Gabapentin was initiated at a dose of 100 mg HS on 2/10/96. 

Mrs. Trent related that she has had a depressed mood in recent months. A son with whom she was close died in August of last year from complications following an admission to the hospital with asthma. This was extremely difficult for Mrs. Trent. She has felt ""alone,"" but has enjoyed visits to the nursing home from Carey and from Carey's aunt, one of Mrs. Trent's daughters. Her other children have not maintained close contact.   

Mrs. Trent had increased weakness and slurring of her speech in early February, which may have been related to a urinary tract infection or sedating medication used at that time. Aside from that episode, Mrs. Trent reported no episodes of weakness, numbness, clumsiness, visual changes, slurred speech, dizziness, language difficulties, or other neurological symptoms concerning for stroke since her stroke in December 2094. 

Past Medical History
type 2 diabetes mellitus requiring insulin
h/o peptic ulcer disease with GI bleeding 
hyperlipidemia 
peripheral arterial disease, bypass surgery on the right leg, mild symptoms of claudication on the left
left internal carotid artery stenosis

Medications (confirmed)
Baclofen 20 MG (10MG TABLET take 2) PO TID 
Clopidogrel 75 MG (75MG TABLET take 1) PO QD 
Gabapentin 100 MG (100MG CAPSULE take 1) PO QHS 
Metoclopramide HCL 10 MG (10MG TABLET take 1) PO AC 
Mirtazapine 30 MG (30MG TABLET take 1) PO QHS 
Multivitamin WITH FOLIC ACID (MULTIVITAMINS) 1 TAB PO QD x 60 days
Novolog (INSULIN ASPART) SC QAM, QPM and SS 
Omeprazole 20 MG (20MG CAPSULE DR take 1) PO QD 
Toprol XL (METOPROLOL SUCCINATE EXTENDED RELEASE) 100 MG (100MG TAB.SR 24H take 1) PO QD 

Allergies
NKA 

Social History
Mrs. Trent is originally from Suriname. She is widowed, with six living children. A son died at age 42 in August, 2095. Mrs. Trent has a remote history of smoking. She does not consume alcohol. She has recently spent much of her time watching television (like soap operas in Dutch) and participating in group activities (such as Bingo) at the home.  

Review of Systems
Negative for chest pain, shortness of breath, visual changes, weakness, numbness, burning pain, paresthesias, difficulties speaking or understanding others, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, pain or burning on urination. Positive for frequent nighttime awakening. Appetite has been ""o.k.""

Exam
Blood Pressure 128/58     Heart Rate 76
Neck: no carotid bruits
Lungs: CTA bilaterally
Heart: regular rate and rhythm, II/VI systolic ejection murmur
ABD: soft, nontender, nondistended, bowel sounds present
EXT: no edema
MS: alert, pleasant, cooperative, good eye contact. Fatigued, mildly depressed looking affect. Oriented to ""LCC"" in ""Galena,"" ""March 2095."" Speech fluent in Dutch. Followed 2-step verbal commands with left hand. Recalled recent events from soap opera episodes in detail. 
CN: pupils 4mm, round, LR to 2mm. EOMI. Mild right UMN facial weakness. Palate elevation symmetrical and tongue protrusion midline.
MOTOR: increased tone with clasp knife phenomenon right arm and leg. Minimal movement of right arm (elbow flexion, index finger extension, finger flexion) and right foot (knee flexion, ankle flexion, toe extension). 5/5 strength in proximal and distal muscles of the left arm and leg. 
SENSORY: reduced sensation to temperature and vibration right arm and leg relative to the left. 
DTRs: 3 in the right biceps, BR, triceps, 2 on the left. Trace patellar and ankle reflexes bilaterally. Right plantar response extensor, left flexor.
CEREB: no dysmetria left finger nose finger. 

MRI brain 12/10/94: small-to-medium sized stroke in the left corona radiata 

CTA head and neck 12/11/94: dense calcification at the carotid bifurcation, precluding a legitimate interpretation.

CNIS 12/14/94: demonstrated 25 to 49% stenosis in the proximal left ICA; velocity of 143 in the proximal ICA versus 50 in the distal CCA suggests a possible moderate (50-70%) stenosis of the vessel

Echocardiogram (transthoracic) 12/14/94: estimated EF of 55 to 60%, no regional wall motion abnormalities, mild left atrial enlargement, and no other significant abnormalities.

Impression
Mrs. Shirley Trent is a 71 year-old right-handed woman who had a stroke in the left corona radiata in December 2094. Her stroke risk factors include history of diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, peripheral arterial disease, and left carotid stenosis with a calcified plaque. She has not had any clinical events suggestive of stroke in the interim between 11/94 and now. Mrs. Trent's current neurological and psychiatric problems include spasticity of the right arm and leg and depression. 

Plan
1. We will obtain repeat carotid studies to assess for interval progression of the left carotid stenosis.
2. We recommend continued management of vascular risk factors, with (1) target BP 120/80 or less, (2) target LDL < 100, (3) continued glycemic control. Continue clopidogrel as an antiplatelet agent.
3. Regarding the spasticity, it is reasonable to utilize a higher evening dose of gabapentin and assess the efficacy. Other potential agents to consider for future use include cyclobenzaprine, tizanidine, and trihexyphenidyl. I will continue to follow and would be happy to discuss this management with you at any time. 
4. I agree with mirtazapine for antidepressant therapy given Mrs. Trent's poor appetite and impaired sleep. After her gabapentin has been appropriately titrated, one may consider increasing mirtazapine to 45 mg HS.
5. Mrs. Trent will be scheduled for follow up in approximately 6 months.

It is a pleasure to participate in the care of Mrs. Trent with you. Greater than 50% of this 60 minute follow up visit was spent counseling regarding the above issues. Please do not hesitate to contact me with questions.


Sincerely,

CC:  N/V, poor PO intake
HPI: Ms. Wilhelm is a 74 year-old woman with a history of HOCM, HTN, DM, and sarcoidosis who underwent a Hartmann&#8217;s procedure with small bowel resection on 10/18 after which she was discharged to Harton Center on 11/07 and then re-admitted to MEDIQUIK on 11/17 with left-sided pleuritic chest pain and a saddle pulmonary embolus as well as large right lower extremity DVT.  She had an IVC filter placed and was started on anticoagulation and discharged again to Harton Center on 12/1 and now presents with nausea, vomiting, and several days of poor PO intake.  This is actually her fifth admission to MEDIQUIK this year &#8211; first in June when she was diagnosed with HOCM and then in July when she was started on empiric steroids for sarcoidosis.  She says her appetite has never returned to normal since her surgery (although her July admission note also documented malaise and poor appetite) and that she has had some mild nausea on a daily basis since her surgery.  The nausea and her fatigue became worse four or five days prior to admission and since then she has been vomiting many times a day.  The nausea is not related to meals and she has not noted any blood in the emesis.  She has had poor intake as a result of the nausea and has only had broth over the last few days.  She denies fevers, chills, headaches, cough, abdominal pain, or change in the character of her colostomy output.  


ED COURSE:  
On arrival to the ED, vitals were as follows: 98, 164/84, 84, 24, 98%/RA.  Her abdomen was non-tender and minimally distended.  CT of the abdomen was concerning for a distal small bowel obstruction although no focal transition point was identified.  She was seen by surgery and an NGT was placed.  She was given 2L of IVF and morphine 2mg IV x2.   


ROS
As above, otherwise reports baseline blurry vision (has been told of cataracts in the past). Denies SOB, cough, CP, chest pressure, orthopnea, palpitations.
Foley catheter in place but denies suprapubic tenderness.

RADIOLOGY/STUDIES:
CXR (12/14):     Lines/tubes:  Interval placement of left-sided PICC line the tip of the PICC line does not cross midline there is a nasogastric tube with the tip below the diaphragm
     Lungs:  There is a persistent opacity in the left mid hemithorax
     Pleura:  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
     Heart and mediastinum:  The heart and the mediastinum are normal.


CT Abd (12/14):     LOWER THORAX: There been interval resolution of the previously identified bilateral pleural effusions.  There is linear atelectasis of the lung bases.
     HEPATOBILIARY: No focal hepatic lesions.  No biliary ductal dilatation.  There are stable findings of porcelain gallbladder.
     SPLEEN: No splenomegaly.
     PANCREAS: No focal masses or ductal dilatation.
     ADRENALS: No adrenal nodules.
     KIDNEYS/URETERS: No hydronephrosis, stones, or solid mass lesions. Two left renal exophytic lesions are identified, stable in size compared with the prior examination and consistent with renal cysts.
     PELVIC ORGANS/BLADDER: There is a Foley catheter in place. There is a fibroid uterus.
     
     PERITONEUM / RETROPERITONEUM: No free air is seen.  There is trace free fluid.
     LYMPH NODES: No lymphadenopathy.
     VESSELS: There are scattered vascular calcifications. An IVC filter is in place.
     GI TRACT: There is diffuse dilation of the proximal and mid small bowel with multiple air fluid levels.  There are loops of nondilated distal small bowel and the colon is not dilated.  There has been a prior  a prior colostomy. There is diverticulosis.
     BONES AND SOFT TISSUES: Unremarkable.
     
     IMPRESSION: Findings concerning for distal small bowel obstruction though no discrete transition point is identified.  Alternately, this could reflect ileus.  Close clinical follow up advised.   




EKG: NSR at 94bpm, leftward axis, biatrial enlargement, normal PR interval, narrow QRS, LVH, TWIs in I, aVL


ASSESSMENT &amp; PLAN
Ms. Wilhelm is a 74 year-old woman with a history of HOCM, hypertension, sarcoidosis, diabetes, who underwent a Hartmann&#8217;s procedure with small bowel resection on 10/18 and was re-admitted on 11/17 with a saddle PE and large RLE DVT for which she was managed with IVC filter and anticoagulation who now presents with several days of nausea and vomiting and concern for small bowel obstruction on CT.  



SBO: Her clinical presentation and CT findings are concerning for small bowel obstruction (although ileus remains a possibility.  Lactate was within normal limits so small bowel ischemia unlikely.  Also abdominal exam remains benign at this time.  

Appreciate surgery input
NGT to low wall suction
NPO except meds for bowel rest
Serial abdominal exams
Check colostomy output guaiac
Acute renal failure: Her creatinine was up from a baseline of 1.0 to 2.1 on admission.  With IVF hydration in the ED it has already started to come down to 1.8 so it was likely pre-renal in the setting of poor intake and vomiting.  

Continue IVF while NPO
Will trend Cr and pursue further ARF work-up if not down on AM labs
Anemia: Baseline hematocrit in low 30s, last 32.6 prior to discharge on 11/30.  She does not appear to have an active source of bleeding and her bilirubin is within normal limits so she is unlikely to be hemolyzing.  She likely either has iron-deficiency anemia (although she has been taking iron supplements) or anemia of chronic disease &#8211; or a combination thereof.  Her RDW is only mildly elevated which likely indicates inappropriately low hematopoiesis.  

Transfuse 1U PRBCs
Check colostomy guaiac
Check iron studies, reticulocyte count
Elevated INR/hypercoagulability: She is baseline hypercoagulable with lupus anticoagulant and has had the recent large DVT/PE s/p IVC filter placement.  She comes in with an elevated INR and is likely supratherapeutic on her coumadin.  She does not need to be reversed as she does not seem to be actively bleeding.

Hold Coumadin for now
Follow up INR, goal 2-3
HOCM/HTN: 

Continue lopressor, verapamil
Sarcoid:

Continue Prednisone at 5mg daily
PAF

Continue Amiodarone &#8211; follow-up with PCP regarding indication for Amio


F/E/N:  NPO
PPX: coumadin, PPI, bowel regimen

Patient: Walton, Levi
MR#: 2554172
GI Attending: Navarrete, Pamela
DOA: 12/18/2096


REASON FOR CONSULT: HCT drop, guaiac +


HPI:
89M admitted on 12/18 with hypotension and HCT drop.


The patient was admitted on Dec 13th and seen by Dr. Esposito from GI.  Per her note, he was admitted with ""complaints of vomiting up food and constant chest pain for 3-4 days. He reports that he has had some troubles with food for the past few months but can't define precisely what the troubles were. It seems that he intermittently vomited or regurgitated both liquids and solids and had a sensation of something getting stuck in his chest. Over the last 3-4 days everything he ate or drank, including water, would come up. He denies nausea. There is no abdominal pain but he describes a constant pain across his chest at the level of his nipples for the past 3-4 days. His pain is currently controlled. He denies pain on swallowing. He does report some weight loss but is unable to identify how much. He denies any new neurologic deficits or headaches.  A barium swallow was obtained which showed a fixed narrowing in the distal esophagus. He has a hx of gastric and duodenal ulcers on endoscopy from 2092 in the setting of NSAID use. He had a normal colonoscopy in 2087.""


During that admission. He underwent upper endoscopy that showed severe esophagitis. Two gastric ulcers with clean bases in the 
prepyloric area which were biopsied.  The duodenum was normal. He was discharged on December 15th with HCT 31.3.


The patient now returns with HCT drop to 19 and hypotension. He reports continued difficulty swallowing and some nausea, vomiting. ""Everything comes up."" He says this has been persistent since his discharge.  He also reports continued black stools since discharge as well. No clear BRBPR. His wife notes one episode of hematemesis yesterday.  No lightheadedness, dizziness, DOE, SOB.  In the ED, hypotensive to 60's / 70's SBP, HCT 19, his ABD CT was negative. INR  pending. He was started on pressors (levophed and vasopressin) and transferred to the MICU for ongoing care.


Currently the patient has no abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, melena, or BRBPR.

STUDIES:
Dec 13th EGD
Impression: - LA Grade D esophagitis. It could represent 
reflux esophagitis, Barrett's esophagitis or 
underlying malignancy. Biopsied.
- Two gastric ulcers with clean bases in the 
prepyloric area which were biopsied.
- Normal examined duodenum.
 
IMPRESSION: 
89M with PMH gastric ulcers and severe esophagitis who returns with HCT drop.  In the setting of guaiac positive stool, he may have bleeding from his gastric ulcers or from the severe esophagitis that was seen endoscopically last week.  He may have a visible vessel at the ulcer site.  Alternatively, he may have a Mallory-Weiss Tear from the wretching due to persistent nausea and vomiting.
 
RECOMMENDATIONS:


1. Please make Patient NPO
2. Please ensure two large bore IV's are in place
3. Active Type and Cross
4. HCT checks TID
5. IV PPI
6. Plan EGD today once resuscitated7.
7. Please check INR and reverse if needed. With an elevated lactate, he may be septic.




Thank you for allowing us to participate in this patient's care.  Please page with any additional questions. 


Attending to Staff.

that he feels like he is in sinus today.  He denies any chest
pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, or edema.  I reviewed
with him his lab results from 10/14/2094, which were remarkable
for a total cholesterol of 242, HDL of 33, triglyceride level of
549, hemoglobin A1c of 9.8, and INR of 1.0.  The patient denies
any symptoms of hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia.

MEDICATIONS:  None.

ALLERGIES:  Penicillin.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is smoking 2 packs per day.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  Weight 193 pounds, blood
pressure 140/98, pulse 92 and regular.  Well-developed,
well-nourished male in no acute distress.  HEENT:  Anicteric
sclerae, oropharynx clear.  Neck:  Supple, no JVD.  Lungs:  Clear
to auscultation bilaterally.  Cardiovascular exam:  Regular rate
and rhythm, S1, S2 normal, no murmur.  Abdomen:  Soft, nontender,
nondistended, normal bowel sounds.  Extremities:  No cyanosis,
clubbing, or edema.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN
1.  Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.  EKG done today showing
normal sinus rhythm at 96 beats per minute with normal intervals,
flat T-waves in leads III, aVF, V5, and V6.  No ST changes.  Will
refer to cardiology regarding whether to anticoagulate him.  Will
treat today with Ecotrin 325 mg p.o. q.d.

Re: Nancy Werner
    MRN 57274347
 
 
Dear Wanda:
 
Nancy Werner is doing better than the last time I saw her in May
in that the triglycerides have decreased to 460, pretty much where
they had usually been.  The LDL is now quite low at 93 but the HDL
has declined to 34.  All in all, the results are compatible with
better glucose control and the action of Atorvastatin 10 mg is
likely responsible for the very low LDL but on the other hand
discontinuation of the gemfibrozil probably lowered the HDL.  The
effect on triglycerides of the low dose of the Atorvastatin is
minimal and overall the triglyceride lowering effect is overrated
except at the high dose of 80 mg.  Even at 80 mg Atorvastatin could
not compare to the fibrates in the triglyceride lowering action.
 
Her current medications are Atorvastatin 10 mg, Lopressor 25 mg,
Procardia 60 mg b.i.d., Capoten 50 mg t.i.d., and  Insulin 22 units
A.M.
 
Labs: Cholesterol 220, TG. 460, HDL 34, LDL 93.
 
Blood pressure is 120/80.
 
I restarted the Gemfibrozil, 600 mg b.i.d. and left her on the
Atorvastatin 10 mg.  Although I don't expect any side effects with
this low dose of Atorvastatin and Gemfibrozil I warned Mrs. Werner
and her husband that if she should have generalized muscle aches or
weakness she should contact us and discontinue medication. 
I think that aggressive therapy is warranted in Mrs. Werner.

RE: Emery, Donn 
NMH#: 059-57-26 
 
Dear Dr. Pacheco:  
 
I had the pleasure of seeing your patient, Donn Emery, in the Internal Medicine recently. Thank you for your kind referral. I will summarize his history and physical examination for my own records.  
 
Mr. Emery is a 86-year-old right-handed gentleman who is referred with complaint and electrophysiologic findings consistent with a generalized sensory motor polyneuropathy. His symptoms began a number of years ago when he noticed bilateral loss of sensation at the tips of his fingers in the hands. This had extended over several months to include his feet as well. Over many months to years he has noticed a weakness of his grip bilaterally, which over the more recent period of time encompassing the last year has been worse on the left. At one time that grip weakness was ascribed to possible carpal tunnel syndrome and he underwent a right carpal tunnel release on the right approximately four years ago. Three weeks ago he underwent a left carpal tunnel release for these same symptoms. He has had no falls, but does note some unsteadiness on his feet. He has had no sensations of tingling or loss of sensory stimulus around his face. He has had no diplopia, dysarthria, dysphagia, or bowel or bladder complaints that might be related to  neurologic problems. He has occasional shortness of breath on exertion. Otherwise, the remainder of his medical and neurologic review of systems is unremarkable.  
 
Past medical history is significant for a past episode of urethral stones, history of lymphoma of unclear type by the medical record but would appear to be non-Hodgkins. He is undergoing extensive surveillance on a yearly basis for recurrence. He has a history of prostate hypertrophy, hypertension, and longstanding history of noninsulin-dependent diabetes since the age of 50. His glucose control by his history has been very good. He has lumbar back pain, a history of a heart murmur.  
 
Current medications include aspirin, Cozaar, clopamide, Triamterene, Tenormin, and Glucophage.  
 
He has no known drug allergies.  
 
He does not smoke, uses alcohol socially, lives in Juneau South, has no obvious toxin exposure to heavy metals.  
 
His family history is negative for obvious neuromuscular disease.  He had a brother who died in his 50s of some sort of brain infection. He has several children, all in good health.   
On my examination today, he is alert and well appearing, with good concentration, memory, and language function. No carotid bruits could be appreciated. The peripheral vascular examination revealed weak pulses in all four limbs.  
 
He had full extraocular motility, with normal visual fields bilaterally. Funduscopy was normal bilaterally. Pupillary reflexes were intact to both light and near stimulation.  The muscles of facial expression, mastication, and the lower bulbar musculature were intact bilaterally.  Facial sensation was intact bilaterally to light touch.  
 
On motor examination, occasional fasciculations were seen throughout. There was clear wasting of the intrinsic muscles of the hands bilaterally, and trace weakness at IV+/V by MRC criteria in a symmetric distribution of the hands bilaterally.  Otherwise, muscles of the proximal shoulder girdle, forearm, and upper arm were V/V bilaterally. In the lower extremities, again, distal muscle wasting was noted, although power in all muscle groups was full.  
 
Sensation testing revealed a moderate-to-severe deficit in vibratory and joint position sense distally in the lower extremities. Temperature, pinprick and light touch sensation appeared to be intact.  
 
There was no dysmetria on finger-nose-finger testing, and gait was not ataxic. Romberg was slightly positive with sway but no fall.  
 
Deep tendon reflexes were hyporeflexic throughout. Specifically I+ reflexes were elicited in the patellar tendons in a symmetric distribution, trace ankle jerks were elicited, and I+ reflexes were elicited in the biceps, triceps, and brachioradialis. There was no jaw jerk. Toes were downgoing bilaterally.  
 
Mr. Emery has already undergone EMG nerve conduction study recently at this institution. Those results were available for me today. They are consistent with a generalized axonal sensory motor polyneuropathy, which is moderate in distal extremities.  Both active and chronic denervation changes are seen on the EMG.  There is no evidence for demyelinating phenotype, and nerve conduction does reveal a conduction block at common sites of compression of the median nerve in the wrist, consistent with carpal tunnel syndrome.  
 
Given the apparent chronic nature of Mr. Emery's complaints, an axonal sensory motor neuropathy most likely idiopathic in origin, or more probably related to the diabetes is the likely diagnosis.  With respect to the weakness in the hands, which appears to encompass more muscle groups than would be accounted for by a median nerve compression at the wrist, this is likely the consequence of this longstanding axonal degeneration. There is no abnormality on the history, examination, or current electrophysiology that would lead me to suspect this is anything more unusual. In addition to the diabetes, of course the primary concern would be lymphoma-related neuropathy, either related to direct lymphomatous invasion of the perineurium, or more  often as a perineoplastic phenomenon. The very chronic nature of his symptoms would argue against this as a likely etiology, and he is, of course, undergoing extensive surveillance for such a recurrence. I would not think that his current symptomatology would be any cause for greater concern regarding new recurrence of  his illness.  
 
Unfortunately, as you know, we are not able to offer anything in the way of therapy for this at this time. We can certainly treat any positive symptoms of painful dysesthesias fairly effectively with antineuropathic pain medications such as Amitriptyline, Gabapentin, or sodium channel agents such as phenytoin or _____.  However, this is not a prominent complaint of Mr. Emery's and this is not likely to be helpful for him. Nevertheless, there may be other therapies in the near future that might be available for this type of problem. I will be happy to continue to see Mr.  Emery on a roughly yearly basis, so that he can keep in touch and be made aware of any therapy that might be helpful and available for him in the future.  
 
If you have any questions please do not hesitate to call me. Once again, thank you for your kind referral.  
 
Sincerely,

THE SPECIALTY HOSPITAL OF AUSTIN

CLINIC NOTE 

Victor Lujan
SMH#:  018-92-33
March 25, 2073


DIAGNOSIS:

Bilateral hand numbness and pain, recurrent carpal tunnel syndrome.

SUBJECTIVE:

The patient is a 54-year-old right-hand dominant male with multiple medical problems including diabetes mellitus and renal failure requiring hemodialysis, who was has had bilateral hand numbness for several years, but getting worse within the last year or so.  The patient states that he has had past carpal tunnel release and trigger finger release of the bilateral hand and the symptoms that he is feeling now is somewhat similar 2-10 years ago appearance of symptoms.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:

Hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and chronic renal failure.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:

Bilateral eye surgeries, right shoulder surgeries, and bilateral carpal tunnel surgery as mentioned above.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS:

Multiple antibiotics including isoniazid, doxycycline, insulin, Cardura, Glucophage, Elavil, and Biaxin.  Please note that the patient is hepatitis C positive and hepatitis B positive.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:

On today s examination, the patient was noted to have a fairly long carpal tunnel scar on bilateral hands extending all the way to the volar wrist level.  Long finger and right index finger scar at the base at the MP joint level is noted, the fourth trigger release, which was performed in 2062 as well.  The patient has rather stiff fingers overall with inability to fully flex the fingers all the way to the thumb space.  There is no locking or triggering, but fairly extensive stiffness involving the flexor tendon was noted.  Durkan s test was positive and Phalen s test was positive as well.  However, abductor pollicis brevis function is intact.  Other examination demonstrated some noticeable decrease in size of the muscle with some prominence of the vasculature on the radial side of the left hand, but otherwise normal examination.

IMPRESSION:

As above.

PLAN:

My recommendation is that patient undergo very vigorous assessment for the median nerve function.  In addition to this, I would like to actually consider providing him with the stretching exercises and flexion exercises as well as passive range of motion of the fingers.  It may be a little to early to consider this option until he returns with the result of EMG nerve conduction study.

Conclusion:     

 

1. Normal left ventricular size with moderate concentric left ventricular

   hypertrophy.  Overall systolic function is mildly reduced with an estimated

   ejection fraction of 42%.  There is severe anterior and anteroseptal

   hypokinesis, extending from base to apex.  No left ventricular thombus is

   detected.  

2. Normal right ventricular size and systolic function.

3. Borderline left atrial enlargement.  Normal right atrial size.

4. The aortic valve is trileaflet with normal leaflet excursion.  No

   significant aortic stenosis or insufficiency is detected.  

5. The aortic root appears normal in size.

6. The mitral valve appears morphologically normal, without prolapse.  There is

   trace mitral regurgitation.   

7. Normal tricuspid valve, without detected regurgitation.  Right ventricular

   systolic pressure could not be estimated due to insufficient tricuspid

   regurgitation.

8. There is no significant pulmonic insufficiency.

9. No significant pericardial effusion.  The inferior vena cava appears normal.

RE:  Xavier Olive

Dear Michael,

Mr. Xavier Olive presents for evaluation, thanks for your
referral.  As you recall he is a 71-year-old gentleman who is
status post angioplasty on the left for high-grade stenotic
lesions of the distal superficial femoral artery and the
popliteal artery on the left.  The patient presents now for
further evaluation of his ""claudication symptoms"".

The patient states he has bilateral lower extremity symptoms,
there are about equivalent in nature.  He has very minimal low
back pain.  He states it seems to be getting worse and seems to
be associated with some abnormal gait.  He states on a bad day
its about a 9/10 and even on a good day sometimes it can be as
high as 8-9/10.  The episodes are almost daily and are brought on
by things like walking.  He can walk less than one block at which
point he has lateral calf burning and at times notes some slow
shuffling and occasionally falling.  When he is having severe
symptoms he notes his legs to be weak.  He denies any bowel or
bladder abnormalities of late, but has a historic of a chronic
UTI secondary to his benign prostatic hypertrophy.  He has very
little back pain associated with his symptomatology.  He has had
no physical therapy to date and no spinal injections.  He
describes his general health as poor, but when specially asked he
states it is because he his 71 and has a history of hypertension.
 Years ago he stated he was in excellent health.  His weight is
steady at 200 with no significant weight gain or loss.  He
doesn't smoke and drinks socially.  Quit smoking 33 years ago. 
He does not think he will ever be pain free.

Review of Systems:  Reveals that he is a diet controlled diabetic
and he has been for the past couple of years.  He has difficulty
with sleep.  He has a balance problem and also has benign
prostatic hypertrophy leading to chronic urinary tract infection,
for this he takes Cardura.  He has a history of high blood
pressure.  Denies any other cardiovascular abnormality.  No
respiratory malfunction.  He has had surgery for something ""in
his colon"" he has also had a bypass surgery.  He is on Plavix and
aspirin.

Physical Examination:  Shows that he is solid built, healthy
appearing male.  He is able to toe and heel walk but on the left
side his T band seems to be slightly weak.  Single toe raises
show that the right leg is stronger than the left leg.  He has no
tenderness to his PSIS and he has no Waddell signs.  He has
negative Trendelenburg bilaterally.  Forward flexion allows him
to get to the patella.  Extension is pain free and passive
hyperextension does not reproduce the symptoms.

Motor testing is normal in his lower extremities.  Sensory is
symmetric.  He has negative straight leg raises.  He has no
palpable pulses.  He is hairless in his lower extremities.  He
had no clonus or Babinski and a negative Hoffman's suggesting
that he is not myelopathic despite his ""balance abnormality"".

He is on multiple meds for his hypertension, for his diabetes,
and for his gastroesophageal reflux.

Personal review of his plain films and a CAT scan indicating
with, show decent residual lumbar lordosis with a stent noted in
his iliac artery on the right.  CT scan shows lumbosacral facet
hypertrophy.

At this point, impression is of spinal stenosis and degenerative
disk disease.  I have asked him to obtain an MRI and return to
see me after that.

Thanks for the referral.

23 Essex Street

East Stroudsburg, GA  97162



Dear Kenneth: 



Mr. Lara returned today after a 1-year hiatus because of coronary disease, status post percutaneous intervention.  He states that his general health has been stable over the past year but over the past several months he has noted, particularly in the hot weather, a sense of dyspnea after walking about 170 feet to his mailbox, or across a large parking lot, such as Grand Union.  At the end of activity he tends to note a sense of regular fluttering in his chest that persists for a minute or two, and he has also noted the latter almost every night when first lying in bed.  He has not had any recurrent orthostatic symptoms since his Toprol dose was reduced last year.  He has not had any exertionally related chest discomfort or symptoms similar to those prior to his percutaneous interventions.



MEDICATIONS:

1.  Aspirin 325 mg daily.

2.  Clopidogrel 75 mg daily.

3.  Atorvastatin 40 mg daily.

4.  Lopid 600 mg b.i.d.

5.  Toprol XL 12.5 mg daily.

6.  Xanax, Benadryl at bedtime, multivitamin.



INTOLERANCE TO MEDICATIONS:

1.  Higher-dose beta blocker - orthostasis.

2.  Lisinopril - questionable contribution to orthostasis.



On examination, he is comfortable at rest.  The blood pressure is 170/100 checked twice, supine, standing it is 160/96, heart rate 82 and regular, weight 204 pounds, oxygen saturation 98%.  The jugular venous pressure is 5.  The carotid upstrokes are symmetric and not delayed.  The chest is clear.  Cardiac exam shows a grade II/VI holosystolic murmur localized to the apex.  The abdominal exam shows no organomegaly, pulsatile masses or bruits.  There is no peripheral pitting edema.



The electrocardiogram shows sinus rhythm with left atrial abnormality and no new ST-T wave abnormalities compared to October 30, 2093.



In summary, Mr. Lara has:

1.  History of CAD, status placement of a drug-eluting stent in the LAD, 7/92, without recurrent angina or signs of left ventricular dysfunction.  Repeat cardiac catheterization, 12/92, because of chest discomfort showed no evidence of restenosis.

2.  Hypertension, not controlled.  His elevated blood pressure may well be contributing to his sense of exertional dyspnea.  We spoke about the options.  As he had developed orthostatic symptoms previously on higher-dose beta blocker and possibly lisinopril, will use smaller doses of alternate agents in an attempt to lower his pressure.  He will add hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg daily plus amlodipine 2.5 mg daily starting today and already has a follow up appointment with you next week.  To investigate potential contributions to the elevated pressure and sense of tachycardia, blood studies today will include electrolytes, plasma metanephrine level and TSH.  A Holter monitor will also be placed in an attempt to determine what he is experiencing with the sense of ""fluttering"" which occurs at least nightly.  Once his blood pressure is controlled, an exercise test will follow.  [Addendum: Holter shows single VPBs/bigeminy at time of his symptoms. Blood studies show normal plasma metanephrines. He reports feeling better with systolic BP in the 120's on September 18, no further palpitations.  He will continue to monitor BP and will call in to schedule ETT]

3.  Dyslipidemia, on combined statin plus gemfibrozil therapy.  When it is time to renew his Lopid, it would be reasonable to switch to TriCor to reduce the potential interaction with statins with respect to myopathy.  A serum CK will be included in today's blood studies.  

4.  Mild mitral regurgitation.



It was a pleasure to see Mr. Lara today and I will report back to you following his Holter.  



With kind regards, sincerely yours,

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 76-year-old man male who comes in for follow up of chronic kidney disease and other medical problems.


PROBLEMS:
1.  Chronic renal disease.  He has dialysis twice per week.  He tells me he is on the transplant list.  The transplant team would like a positive CVS treated with levofloxacin
2.  Hyperlipidemia.  Fasting lipid analysis 2 weeks ago showed total cholesterol 255, triglycerides 203, HDL 39, and LDL 175.  He had been taking Crestor but says the bottle emptied and he did not know to refill it.
3.  Secondary hyperparathyroidism.  Recent PTH 829, calcium 10.1, and phosphorus 6.7.
4.  Superficial back pain.  He had an abscess drained overlying the right scapula several months ago.  Since then, he has had some mild pain.


MEDICATIONS:  He did not bring any tonight.  As listed:
1.  Aspirin 325 mg daily.
2.  Nephrocaps 1 daily.
3.  Phoslo 2001 mg t.i.d.


REVIEW OF SYMPTOMS:  No significant weight change, febrile signs or symptoms, headache, blurred vision, tinnitus, chest pain, cough, shortness of breath, nausea, abdominal pain, nightsweats, diarrhea, dysuria, polyuria, bruising, joint pain, or focal weakness.  


PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient is in no acute distress.  Chest:  Clear to percussion and auscultation.  Skin exam:   There are two small cavities overlying the right scapula  filled with dirt and slight surrounding erythema..  Abdominal exam:  No masses, tenderness or organomegaly.  Extremities:  No edema.


ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
1.  Chronic kidney disease.  On dialysis.
2.  Hyperlipidemia.  I prescribed Zocor.
3.  Secondary hyperparathyroidism.  I am concerned about bone status.  Bone mineral density exam requested.
4.  Skin changes after abscess drainage.  Area was cleaned and covered.
 The patient has history of elevated total protein and amylase.  Will need follow up.

MARVINYANDELL,GRACE   904-68-07-1              VISIT DATE: 08/06/96

HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  This patient is a 68 year old 

woman who is being seen by Dr. Dodd who had what was a syncopal 

episode on the premises.  A code was called when bystanders and 

medics reported she was on the floor, diaphoretic and clammy.  The 

patient drank something and then proceeded to be taken to the 

Emergency Department. 

The patient had a cystoscopy planned for today.  She took her 

medication for her diabetes and presented here with weakness, 

nausea, diaphoresis and felt like she may have passed out.  Her 

other complaint was mild back pain from passing out.  No epigastric 

pain or tenderness and no chest pain.  The patient never had any 

chest pain prior to her event.  She is followed by the United Medical Center East and their input is pending at this point. 

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  The patient has a past medical history 

significant for diabetes, hypertension, hypothyroidism and 

migraines. 

MEDICATIONS:  The patient's current medications include Plavix, 

Calan slow release and Glucophage. 

ALLERGIES:  The patient is allergic to intravenous pyelogram dye, 

Percocet, penicillin, cephalosporin and lisinopril. 

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  HEENT:  Examination is normal.  LUNGS: 

Clear bilaterally.  CARDIAC:  Regular rate and rhythm with no 

murmurs.  ABDOMEN:  Soft and nontender.  EXTREMITIES:  Normal. 

GENERAL:  The patient looks well and has no complaints here. 

LABORATORY EVALUATION:  Finger stick in the Emergency Department 

was 160.  Electrocardiogram shows some PR depressions in multiple 

leads.  No significant ST elevations. 

THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  Impression is this patient is a 68 

year old female with planned cystoscopy today who passed out on the 

premises.  A code was called overhead.  Bystanders reported that 

the patient was diaphoretic.  They gave her something to drink. 

Her blood sugar here was within normal limits.  The patient has no 

complaints of chest pain or shortness of breath.  She looks well 

but does have PR depressions on electrocardiogram but has no rubs 

or gallops on her electrocardiogram.  The patient was made NPO 

because of her cystoscopy procedure. 

FINAL DIAGNOSES: 

1.  Syncopal episode versus presyncope from the taking of her 

diabetes medicine this morning. 

2.  PR depression on electrocardiogram which appears to be new.  No 

old electrocardiogram to compare.  We need to address the PR 

depressions.  This is possibly pericarditis but it is unlikely.  I 

would think that this more likely ischemia than pericarditis. 

3.  Cardiac ischemia. 

DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  The patient will 

need admission and a formal rule out.  She may even need an 

echocardiogram inpatient.  A full work up is pending.  The 

patient's full disposition is pending and she was signed out to Dr. 

Aleta Nunley at 15:00.

RE: Jacob Rodriquez, M.D.
    MR #863-35-65-5

Dear Dr. Faust: 

Thank you for kindly referring your patient, Jacob Rodriquez, to the
Internal Medicine for evaluation of pulmonary hypertension.
Although I'm sure you are familiar with his history, I will review
it now for our records. Dr. Rodriquez is a 77-year-old retired Electrician
at Wells Fargo who by his report has enjoyed excellent
health until the past year. He denies any prior history of
hypertension, coronary artery disease, chest pains, significant
childhood illnesses or malignancy. He describes his usual baseline
health as excellent. He is a religious walker, walking multiple
times each week as well as a woodwind and singing enthusiast. Dr.
Rodriquez states that in approximately April or Mayof the past year he
was first diagnosed with hyperglycemia. This was treated with
Metformin. Subsequently Hydrochlorothiazide and Zestril were added
apparently for hypertension (although the patient does not believe
he has been diagnosed with hypertension). He subsequently developed
diarrhea which he felt was related to Glucophage which was
subsequently reduced in dose. In June of the past year the patient
was noted to be anemic which was felt to be related to sulfa in his
Hydrochlorothiazide. At that time he also was found to have lower
extremity edema which worsened with the discontinuation of the
Hydrochlorothiazide. The patient states in September of 2119 he
traveled to trinidad and tobago. While in trinidad and tobago he had a
marked increase in his lower extremity edema to the point that he
found it difficult to ambulate. He denied any difficulty with chest
pains or shortness of breath. He had no hemoptysis and no focal
unilateral leg swelling despite the long period of immobility
during the trip. He was seen by a Trinidad physician who prescribed an
ethacrynic acid which reduced his lower extremity edema
significantly. However, he subsequently developed diarrhea to this
medication and it was stopped. Subsequently his lower extremity has
once again worsened and has been treated with increasing doses of
Lasix and with the recent addition of Zaroxolyn. At the present
time Dr. Rodriquez states that he has no overt shortness of breath. He
still able to sing vigorously and to play woodwinds without any 

Page 2
Freeman Faust, M.D. 
RE: Jacob Rodriquez, M.D. 
January 18, 2120


limitation. He does find ambulating difficult due to the swelling
in his lower extremities. He has no chest pain, has no cough, no
sputum production, no hemoptysis. He has no fevers or chills. He
believes his weight is increased by 35 pounds in the past several
months. He believes this is entirely due to edema accumulation. He
denies any difficulties with disrupted sleep although he does note
that he's becoming increasingly fatigued during the day and is
often napping in the reclining chair which is new for him. He
denies any history of snoring. He has noted no new joint complaints
although he has had a pruritic eruption on the anterior surface of
his right lower extremity as well as on his left arm. This has been
present for approximately two or three months. Other than that he
believes his bowel and bladder function is normal. Review of
systems is otherwise unremarkable. 

His past medical history is significant for:
     1. Type II diabetes as above. 
     2. An apparent diagnosis of labile hypertension noted in his 
        chart. 
     3. Anemia thought secondary to Hydrochlorothiazide. 
     4. Past history of right bundle branch block. He has no      
        history of rheumatic fever. 

Current medications include Atenolol 25mg daily, folic acid,
Glucophage 850mg bid, Lasix 120mg daily, Lisinopril 15mg daily,
compression stockings, Metolazone 2.5mg daily was added recently. 

Drug allergies include possible hemolytic anemia due to
Hydrochlorothiazide. 

Family history is significant for diabetes mellitus. 

Social history is assuming for the fact that the patient is an
immigrant from trinidad and tobago. He has been living in Haleyville
since the early 2059's. He is a Electrician at Wells Fargo. He
has minimal exposure to chemicals in his research towards his
bachelor's degree but none since then. He is a non tobacco user. He
uses alcohol minimally. He's never had any blood transfusions. He
lives with his wife. They have no pets. He does not enjoy any
unusual hobbies not noted above. He has been exposed to
tuberculosis in the past and has a history of a positive PPD. 

On physical examination today Dr. Rodriquez weighs 193 pounds. Blood
pressure is 136/90. Pulse 83 and regular. Respiratory rate is 20.
Temperature is 96.8. Resting oxygen saturation is 98-99% with
ambulation in the hallway. This fell to a minimum of 97% with an
increase in his heart rate to 100. HEENT exam is significant for a
clear oropharynx. Sclera are white. Conjunctiva are minimally pale.

RE: Jacob Rodriquez, M.D. 
January 18, 2120


The thyroid gland is normal. Jugular venous distention to
approximately 10 cm. was noted. Neck was supple. Examination of the
chest revealed diminished breath sounds bilaterally with dullness
at both bases. There was no egophony and no wheezes. Otherwise the
lungs were clear. Cardiac exam with a regular rate in rhythm,
normal S1 and S2, an intermittent S4 was appreciated. No RV heave
or lift was appreciated. No pulmonary artery tap was appreciated.
The pontic component of S2 was moderately enhanced. No appreciable
murmurs were detected. The point of maximum impulse was in the
anterior axillary line. Examination of the abdomen revealed a
nontender abdomen with a palpable liver edge, three fingerbreadths
below the right costal margin. This was nontender and smooth.
Minimal splenomegaly was also appreciated as well. Normal bowel
sounds were present. Examination of the extremities reveal three
plus symmetric edema to the top of the thigh in the lower
extremities, one plus edema was also present in both upper
extremities. No clubbing was noted. There were no skin changes
consistent with collagen vascular disease. Multiple follicular
lesions were noted on the anterior aspect of the right thigh as
well as on the left arm. Neurological exam was grossly nonfocal. 

Objective data include a CBC which most recently demonstrated a
white count of 11.8, hematocrit of 32.1, platelet count of 250.
Differential was not remarkable. LVH is elevated at 599, AST is
most recently 22. A urinalysis on 12/07/19 was negative for
protein. No reportive cast was made. A CEA was notable for a level
of 2.4 on 1/05/20. An echocardiogram obtained on 12/22/19
demonstrated normal LV size with mild concentric LVH and preserved
LV function. The right ventricle was mildly dilated and
hypertrophied with mild reduction in RV function. There was trace
MR with moderate TR. A peak systolic artery pressure of 64 plus
right atrial pressure was noted. 

In summary Dr. Rodriquez is a 77-year-old gentleman with a clear cut
pulmonary hypertension. The etiology of this is not clear at the
moment. Differential diagnosis could include chronic thromboembolic
disease, occult underlying pulmonary disease (doubt), obstructive
sleep apnea, and collagen vascular disease. In addition some
patients develop a marked pulmonary artery hypertension in the
setting of stiff left ventricle even with preserved left
ventricular function although this I think would be a diagnosis of
exclusion. The degree of his edema is quite striking and I agree
with increasing his diuretic regimen. I'm embarking on a course of
evaluation to exclude the most likely causes. In specific he will
be having a CT with IV contrast to rule out chronic thromboembolic
disease this afternoon. This has already been arranged by Dr.
Faust. In addition I'm sending serology including an ANA, an
antidouble stranded DNA and an anti SCL70. I've also asked Dr. Rodriquez
Page 4
Freeman Faust, M.D. 
RE: Jacob Rodriquez, M.D. 
January 18, 2120


to undergo polysonography to exclude obstructive sleep apnea. He
will be following up with our pulmonary function lab to have formal
pulmonary function testing performed in addition to having an
arterial blood gas drawn. If this evaluation should be unrevealing,
he may require more invasive diagnostics. I've already consulted
formally with Dr. Eddie Roy, the physician with most
experience in pulmonary hypertension at this hospital and he would
be able to assist us in the further evaluation of Dr. Rodriquez if our
workup is nondiagnostic.  

Dr. Faust, thank you again for referring Dr. Rodriquez for evaluation.
I'll plan on seeing him in approximately three to four weeks after
his diagnostic tests have been performed. Please do not hesitate to
call me with any further questions or concerns. 

Sincerely, 




Jose Church, M.D.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This pleasant 62-year-old African American 
gentleman returns to my clinic today for follow-up of diabetes, status 
post MI, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension.

1.  He brings in his blood sugar values with him today.  These are 
improved since his last visit, and somewhat more believable ranging from 
128 to 195, predominantly higher in the evenings more than the mornings 
ranging from 150 to 190.  He is currently on a somewhat odd regime of 6 
units of insulin regular twice a day, with a large 24 units of insulin 
at night, and 14 units insulin in the morning.  He has not had any 
further hypoglycemic attacks, is having no nocturnal awakening, and 
seems to be sticking more to the diet.  He has however gained some 
weight, which is a little disconcerting.  He does attend a podiatrist 
and is doing well from that perspective.  He is to return to the 
ophthalmologist for further diabetic screening later on in the year.  He 
missed his last nutrition appointment and is not interested in further 
follow-up with nutrition at this time.
2.  Cardiovascular.  He is on atorvastatin 20 mg for hyperglyceridemia, 
atenolol 25 mg, and aspirin.  Further question regarding his stroke back 
in 2061 shows that this presents with confusional episode with 
unsteadiness, resolving after approximately 36 hours, and he was found 
to have a hole in his heart at that time.  He was eventually stopped off 
Coumadin in 2063, but had a recurrent episode at that time and he was 
put on Coumadin for life at that point.  He had an aborted myocardial 
infarction in 2067.  He has had no chest pain in the interim, has good 
exercise tolerance with walking, although, he can only run about 50 
yards before getting very short of breath.  He has no orthopnea or PND.  
He has no chest pain or use of sublingual nitro.
3.  Health maintenance.  We discussed screening colonoscopy versus 
flexible sigmoidoscopy and the relative benefit of each of those.  He 
has agreed to proceed with colonoscopy, and I have instructed him stop 
his Coumadin and aspirin five days before the test and to have an INR 
checked on the day prior to the test.  This will be scheduled by our 
secretary.  He will restart the Coumadin after the colonoscopy at his 
standard dose and titrate up slowly.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Include aspirin, atenolol, insulin, Coumadin, and 
Lipitor.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  His blood pressure is 148/82.  He is tachycardic 
at 98 beats per minute.  Examination of his eyes shows persistent left-
sided cataract.  Examination of the heart and lungs was normal.  The 
abdominal examination is also normal.  His injection sites were clean 
and without erythema.  There is no evidence of peripheral neuropathy and 
his feet appeared well.

We spent some time today talking about diabetes education again, 
including appropriate foods, drinks, and what items to avoid.

PLAN:
1.  Supplied educational materials regarding diabetes management, 
including calorie counting, weight loss, information about hypoglycemia 
and hyperglycemia, and diabetic eye care.
2.  I have increased insulin in the mornings from 14 to 16 units and 
left the other doses as is.
3.  I have increased the atenolol from 25 mg to 50 mg for hypertension 
and cardioprotection with the tachycardia.
4.  We will check cholesterol, hemoglobin A1c, CBC, and chem-7.
5.  I have scheduled an elective outpatient colonoscopy as detailed 
above for colorectal cancer screening.
6.  Return to see in a week's time, understands.  He can discuss any 
management issues regarding his insulin doses or others anytime.

Internal Medicine G Intern Admission Note

PATIENT:  Wilhelm, Goldy

MRN: 9543443

ADMIT DATE: 8/2/98

PCP:  Dr. Casey Frey



HPI: 74F with sarcoidosis, HTN, CHF, HOCM, PE s/p IVC filter now on coumadin, PVD s/p L BKA, and DM who presents from her rehab facility with failure to thrive and increasing lethargy for several weeks. Of note, pt had recent admission to MEDIQUIK (6/29-7/05) at which time she presented with similar complaints of fatigue/lethargy and routine CBC demonstrated an elevated WBC (15) and low Hct (23). She was ultimately found to have an Enterococcus bacteremia and intra-abdominal abscess that grew out E. coli. She underwent IR drainage of the abdominal collection and completed a course of Vanc/CTX. Outpatient f/u abd CT (7/18) showed near complete resolution of the intra-abdominal collection. Since that time, however, pt&#8217;s sons report increasing lethargy at her nursing facility. Patient has no complaints. Specifically, she denies fatigue, chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, motor weakness and fevers and chills. However, given concern on the part of her sons, pt was taken to the MEDIQUIK ED. 



In the MEDIQUIK ED, she was afebrile with HR 70, BP 150/74, RR 24, and Sa02 100% RA.

U/A: 0-2 RBCs, 20-50 WBCs, moderate squams



EKG: 84bpm, sinus, normal axis, ST elevations in V2-V3 (old)



Imaging: 

CXR (8/2/98): 1.  Increased interstitial markings may represent worsened mild pulmonary edema or interstitial infection.



Abd CT (7/18/98): Near complete resolution of previously seen left lower quadrant fluid collection. Stable small cystic lesions in pancreas which likely represent side branch IPMN.



Abd CT (6/30/98): New 4.8 x 4.0 cm thick walled fluid collection in the LLQ which contains a small amount of gas.  This would be amenable to percutaneous drainage. Small bilateral pleural effusions, decreased in size. Bilateral benign renal cysts. Gallbladder wall calcifications.



A/P: 74F with sarcoidosis, HTN, CHF, HOCM, PE s/p IVC filter now on coumadin, PVD s/p L BKA, and DM who presents from her rehab facility with failure to thrive and increasing lethargy for several weeks. 



1. Failure to thrive / lethargy: The etiology of this pt&#8217;s lethargy is unclear. It is notable, however, that her presentation on this admission is very similar to her presentation in July at which time she was found to be bacteremic with an additional intra-abdominal bacterial collection. At present, there is no clear source of infection, although her urinalysis is suspicious for a UTI. Elevated WBC in someone on chronic steroids is concerning for infection, but pt is hemodynamically stable and afebrile. In addition to bacteremia, UTI and re-accumulation of an intra-abdominal collection, other possible causes of her lethargy include toxic/metabolic causes (such as uremia), anemia, or depression. 

                - F/u blood,  urine, and respiratory cultures

                - Will hold off on empirically starting abx based on urinalysis (If we were to start abx, would 

                 recommend vanc/cefepime given micro history)

- Culture if spikes

                - Consider repeat abd imaging if pt continues to have a leukocytosis and doesn&#8217;t clinically 

                 improve



2. Anemia &#8211; Source of anemia has been unclear in the past. During last admission, pt was found to be guaiac positive on rectal exam but guaiac negative out of colostomy. GI at that time had deferred colonoscopy. It is possible that her anemia may be responsible for her failure to thrive. 

                - Type and screen

                - Will transfuse 1 unit of pRBCs and monitor for clinical improvement

                - Check post-transfusion Hct 



3. HTN &#8211; pt has long-standing refractory hypertension despite numerous anti-hypertensive agents

                - Per pharmacy recommendations, holding propranolol given h/o SOB

                - Continue clonidine, verapimil and hydral (titrate as needed)

4. Elevated INR &#8211; pt has a supratherapeutic INR. Given that pt is near discharge Hct from previous admission, do not feel that she is actively bleeding. As such, do not feel the need to actively reverse her. 

                - Monitor daily INRs

                - Hold warfarin overnight



5. Renal insufficiency &#8211; Cr 1.58 today (baseline 1.2). Likely secondary to prerenal 

                - Fluid resuscitation 

                - Recheck lytes in AM

PCP:   Dr. Rose Irvin-Ly



CC:  right sided weakness

HPI:  The patient is a 70 year-old right-handed Dutch-speaking female with history of DM, PVD presenting to ED with right-sided weakness which started yesterday morning.  The patient's grand-nephew is translating, initially, then joined by Dutch interpreter; history is challenging to obtain.  The patient reports that since she awoke in the AM on 12/07/94, she noticed that her RUE and RLE was weak and numb.  She apparently had come to the ED about 2 days ago for RLE numbness and pain which has been worsening over the past 1-2 months, but reportedly had good strength on neurological exam, and she was not admitted.  She was given  a 2-day course of Levaquin for UTI.  She states that despite the pain in the RLE 2 days ago, she was able to move her RLE whereas since yesterday she has not been able to move it as easily or bear weight.  She also noted that her RUE was weak, and she was unable to raise it very far off the bed.  She was unable to walk independently since yesterday, and required full assistance of her son to walk to the bathroom.  She has had no facial weakness.  She has never had weakness of this kind in her right arm or leg, but had similar weakness in the left arm and leg in 2089 which completely resolved.  She states that she has had a mild right-sided headache since yesterday AM.  Since this morning, she has had nausea and vomiting as well (did not have this yesterday), and has not had any fevers or chest pain.  She has had SOB today. She reports having frequent BLE spasms, usually at night, and her legs become quite restless.

Prelim:  Mulitple regions of hypodensity in the subcortical white matter bilaterally, and in bilateral capsulothalamic regions as well as the left caudate/periventricular region.



MRI/MRA head and neck:

Not yet completed.



Recent MRI of L-spine 11/24/94:

The vertebral bodies, posterior elements, and alignment are

	intact.  Very prominent facet degeneration is seen on the right at

	L5-S1, and less prominently elsewhere.

	 

	There is straightening of the lumbar spine.

	 

	T12-L1, L1-L2, L2-L3, L3-L4:  Normal caliber canal and foramina.

	 

	L4-L5:  Mild broadbased bulge and facet hypertrophy is not

	associated with significant stenosis.

	 

	L5-S1:  Prominent facet hypertrophy as described with ligamentum

	hypertrophy and broadbased disk protrusion mildly narrows the

	central canal and mildly narrows each foramen.  There is narrowing

	of the lateral recesses on each side, and may be impingement of

	the traversing S1 nerve roots, more prominent on the right, as

	seen in images 17 and 18 of the axial sequence.



Old CT brain 6/16/89:

Mildly prominent ventricles and subarachnoid spaces are

	not uncommon for a patient of this age.  There are no regions of

	hypoattenuation within the brain to suggest a prior infarction.  Basal

	ganglia and basis pontis appear normal without evidence of lacunar

	infarction.  No significant periventricular white matter changes are

	evident.



_______________________________________________________________

IMPRESSION:  70 year-old right-handed female with h/o DM, PVD presenting to ED for RUE and RLE numbness and weakness, onset 12/07/94 AM.  She has had numbness/tingling and shooting pain in the RLE for the past 1-2 months likely due  to disease in the lumbar spine seen on MRI (L5-S1).  She states that the current weakness in the RLE is new, as is the weakness in the RUE.  Additionally, she has new nausea/vomiting and SOB since this AM.  While in the ED, following her CT scans, she was tachycardic to the 150s and hypertensive to the 230s systolic.  She had persistent nausea and vomiting.  



Her neurological exam was difficult with inconsistent findings.  She appears to have decreased spontaneous movement of the RUE, but when passively moved into shoulder flexion she was able to hold the position against gravity for several seconds.  Her RLE symptoms are likely confounded by her lumbar spine disease at L5/S1 as noted above.  She is hyperglycemic (serum glucose 313), has a mild leukocytosis, is iron deficient, and has new onset today of fairly severe nausea/vomiting and SOB of unclear etiology.  She appears to have vasculopathic changes/lacunes in the brain seen as hypodensities on the CT today, all appearing old.  She does not have any right facial weakness, no dysarthria, no aphasia, no flaccidity/spasticity, no gaze preference.  While stroke can not be ruled out, her exam does not clearly suggest a typical stroke syndrome.  Ddx includes seizure, infection or metabolic abnormality causing unmasking of stroke-like symptoms, migraine phenomena superimposed on current medical/metabolic abnormalities.





RECOMMENDATIONS:

1.	MRI/MRA of the head and neck (stroke protocol), as well as MRI of C-spine given UE symptoms

2.	We currently recommend admission to medicine given multiple medical issues (severe HTN, SOB as yet unexplained, N/V, hyperglycemia).

3.	BP control:  Labetolol to maintain BP less than 200 systolic; avoid large/rapid shifts to maintain cerebral perfusion pressure.  Would allow some degree of hypertension (max 200 SBP) until stroke protocol MRI/MRA obtained.

4.	Glycemic control-need to clarify home insulin regimen

5.	Resend cardiac markers in setting of tachycardia to 150s

6.	F/u PE protocol CT (done in ED).

7.	Patient will be followed by the Neurology consult service.



This case was discussed with Dr. James Rosado MD, senior Neurology resident.

Reason for Visit

Comprehensive evaluation and follow-up of problems.



Problems

      Shortness of breath

11/93 after starting atenolol (and wt gain) devel DOE w/o wheezing. Resolved off it (and w inc lasix 60 --> 80). ETT 12/93 neg to 7 METS, echo 12/93 mild/mod MR, Ao scle w/o sten, LV mild dil 55, LA mod dil,  EF 72%, no RWMA, mod sym LVH, all c/w diastolic dysfunction.

      Lumbar disc disease

4/94 seen for 9 days L buttock--> post thigh pain w/o trauma. No improvement at 2 weeks and MRI done--> mild L4-5 and L5-S1 disc disease, facet DJD and B foraminal encroachment L5-S1. Sx resolved.

      Spell        

4/4/90 at Gym while lying down with his head back, he had dizziness and then weakness.  Seen in Cedars ER with vital signs and sugar fine.  ECG unchanged and not reproducible.  Turns out he's had similar sxs for about 30 years, always with his head back.  TCDs here okay except ? of middle cerebral artery, resolved with spinal CT angio.  

	No further episodes.

      hypertension        

PRESENT SINCE MID 2060'S. HAD BEEN FOLLOWED BY DR. TITUS AT DARDANELLE HOSPITAL. 

	ETT 5/12/82 TO 98% PRMHR SHOWED ST CHANGES WHICH WERE SUGGESTIVE BUT NOT DIAGNOSTIC AND THERE WAS BASELINE LVH WITH STRAIN BUT THALLIUM WAS NEG. THERE WERE OCCASIONAL PVC'S AND COUPLETS AND TWO 3 BEAT RUNS OF VT.     HAD BEEN ACCEPTABLE ALBEIT ON AN ELABORATE REGIMEN THAT HAD EVOLVED. SUBOPTIMAL WITH ADDITIONAL WEIGHT GAIN 5/23/86. WILL RECHECK 6-8 WEEKS AFTER 8-10 LB WEIGHT LOSS. ETT THAL SCHEDULED, GIVEN ABNL ECG, RISK FACTORS, AND HIS CONTINUING DESIRE TO EXERCISE. 

	5/86 EXCELLENT EXERCISE CAPACITY TO 9 METS, ECG NONDIAGNOSTIC DUE TO BASELINE ABNORMALITIES BUT THALLIUM NL.     

	150/74 7/86 AND WILL ACCEPT THIS FOR NOW BUT STILL NEEDS TO LOSE WEIGHT. 

	140/78 9/86 WO WEIGHT LOSS. REDISCUSSED IT WOULD MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO SIMPLIFY HIS REGIMEN CONSIDERABLY. HE REMAINS ON VERY ELABORATE REGIMEN THAT HE HAD BEEN ON FOR YEARS BY DR. TITUS.   (8/8/87)

[28-Aug-2088]

	REASONABLE CONTROL ON REGIMEN, BUT STILL NEEDS WEIGHT LOSS.  78-9 really not adequate control with his mild diabetes; increased Cardura to 8 mg without help.  Change Procardia XL to Norvasc with increase from 15 to 20 mg.  BP control acceptable. 

	7/91 still a bit suboptimal, and has continued so w wt gain. Lisinopril increased from 40mg qd to bid, lasix from 40 to 60 qd.  7/92 still 140/70. Wt down 5.5 from peak., at 228#  Not improved, so  dec lisinopril to 40 mg and added Irbesartan w good response, though 7/93 suboptimal 140/70 and subsequent ~ 135.  Inc 160-->240 7/94. Following chems. Continue to emphasize weight loss.

DISCUSSED DIETARY CHANGE AT LENGTH. 8/87 VISIT.  (8/8/87)  A1C 6.10 = 117.  BLOOD SUGARS BECAME HIGHER, HE DID ACCEPT NUTRITION REFERRAL, BEGUN ON METFORMIN 500 BID WITH GI SXS WHEN 3RD DOSE ADDED.  5/88 A1C 7.04 = 149.  AT THAT POINT HAD LOST 14 POUNDS.  [28-Aug-2088]



Gets regular eye f/u. Have emphasized importance of caring for feet. 7/94 beginning to get slight neuropathic pain.

	STARTED ON METFORMIN WITH A1C NORMAL AT 500 BID.  1/90 A1C 6.60.  Urine microalbumin is high and this was discussed.  Already on good dose ACEI and try to control BP.

LAST EPISODE WAS ABT A YR AGO. NO HO UROLITHIASIS. DISCUSSED POSSIBLE ROLE OF FUROSEMIDE, AND SINCE IT IS NOT ENTIRELY CLR TO ME WHY HE NEEDS TO BE ON A HIGH DOSE OF FUROSEMIDE IT MAY BE POSSIBLE FOR THIS TO BE ADJUSTED. HOWEVER, NO FURTHER EPISODES.  UNTIL POSTOP 3/86 ATTACK.  HAVE REDUCED FUROSEMIDE.  Spring 2088 HAVING SOME MILD SXS THAT COULD BE PODAGRA AND SOME ANKLE SXS, THOUGH W/O OVERT INFLAMMATION.

Please see admit note for details of patients presentation. 

Briefly, Pt is a 59 yo man with the following CV risk factors: smoker, HTN who presents with L sided chest pain and found to have inf STEMI no w s/p baremetal stent x 3 placement awaiting repeat catherization for L Circ PCI.

CCU course by problem:

Cardiac Ischemia     Pt presented with L sided Chest pain, EKG showed 2-3 mm STE in I, aVL and STD in V4-6.

start Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q.d.  She will return in six weeks for

follow up of this.

3.  Hypertension.  Her blood pressure is acceptable.  We will

continue her current regimen.  Results were given as needed.

4.  Allergy symptoms.  I gave her Rhinocort AQ nasal spray. 

Explained how to use it.

5.  Nodular hyperpigmented lesion on her forefeet.  I will refer

her to Dermatology for evaluation of this lesion, but the patient

says that it has been there for as long as she can remember but

it is quite atypical to my exam.

6.  Left renal cystic mass.  She has been scheduled for a

follow-up MRI for December 13.

7.  Asthma:  She is doing stably in this regard and I believe

that nasal spray will help substantially with her symptoms.

Nikkolas Nancy-Jasmine

693-31-18-1



I saw Nikkolas Nancy-Jasmine today for evaluation concerning his stroke in August 2091.  The information available today is limited to his knowledge of the events.



He is an 67-year-old Honduran man with a history of diabetes mellitus and HTN.  In August he suffered a stroke.  He reports that his speech was affected and that he developed severe right arm and leg weakness without sensory loss.  He recalls no problem with his vision.  He was hospitalized at Dubuque Obstetrics Gynocology Center.  He does no know the extent of the evaluation.  He was discharged on aspirin to Mitchell County Hospital.  He is now living at home with his wife and son with visiting nurse assistance.  His primary care physician is at Flagler Hospital.  He has severe residual weakness of the right arm and leg.  He also complains of dizziness and an abnormal numbness in his mouth.  The dizziness is worst in the morning.  He also notices a noise in his head when he sleeps.



He has DM and HTN.  He is a nonsmoker.  I don't have cholesterol information.  There is no history of cardiac disease.  There is no history of alcohol abuse.



He is currently taking aspirin, insulin, antihypertensive medication of some type and possibly a cholesterol lowering agent, although he is no sure of this.  He has no known allergies.



He is aware of no significant family history.



He is married.  He lives with his wife and 22-year-old son.  He came to america from Honduras in 2073.  He worked nights in construction until his stroke.



Pulse 66, regular.  BP 186/110.  There are no cranial bruits.  The carotid pulses are full with no bruits.  The lungs are clear.  The heart is regular with no murmur.  The abdomen is benign.  The mental state is normal; he speaks Spanish and broken English.  He is able to name, repeat, and comprehend well.  His fluency in his native language is probably normal.  Cranial nerves are intact.  There is severe weakness of the right arm and leg: right interossei and finger flexors 1/5, finger extensors 0/5, biceps 1/5, triceps 0-1/5, deltoid 0-1/5.  (He tries to raise his arm proximally by elevating the shoulder.)  Right iliopsoas 2/5, quadriceps 2/5, hamstrings 1/5, distally 0/5.  The tone is only mildly increased.  Sensation is intact.  Reflexes are slghtly brisker in the right upper extremity (RUE 2+/4, LUE 2/4, knees 2+/4, ankles 2/4).  The right plantar response is mute; he withdraws the left.  Coordination is intact; weakness inhibits adequate testing on the right.  He wears a right AFO.  He can stand up from his wheelchair and bear weight maneuvering himself to the examining table, but he cannot walk unsupported.



His examination is most consistent with a right equal arm and leg pure motor hemiparesis, sparing the face.  This was likely due to a lacunar infarction in the left basis pontis from small vessel occlusion.  He has major stroke risk factors, including DM, HTN, and probably hypercholesterolemia.  Currently his major needs are to establish good control of his blood pressure and to control other risk factors, including optimtal glucose control and likely medication for hyperlipidemia, and to continue physical and occupational therapy to maximize his functional status.



To review the studies that were done to investigate his stroke in August, I will request the record of that hospitalization from DOGC.  I will also request his records from his physician at the Flagler Hospital.  He will certainly need an adjustment of his antihypertensive regimen.  He tells me that he is planning to see his PCP for this purpose.  I asked him to return here in a month to review this.





Sincerely,







Patrick Winn, M.D.

Procedure:  The patient is a 71 year old Spanish-speaking female scheduled for right colectomy.  Surgery is scheduled on May 31, 2066 by Dr. Patrick Frantz.



Chief Complaint & Present Illness:  Patient reports that she was having difficulty with constipation and colonoscopy was scheduled 5/07/66.  Colonoscopy showed a malignant appearing tumor or possibly a villous adenoma in the cecum.  Pathology revealed adenocarcinoma.



Patient reports a history of angina stating that it is usually precipitated by stress or anxiety as well as exertion.  Describes angina as left-sided anterior chest pain that is stabbing in nature and constant.  Sometimes she gets relief from this pain by applying pressure to chest with her hand.  However, if pain is severe enough she usually takes one nitroglycerin tablet.  Occasionally nausea will accompany chest pain.  States pain occurs most frequently at night and she usually confines herself to taking nitroglycerin tablets only at night, not with daytime pain.  Most recent stress test done 11/63 showed that patient had a normal exercise capacity, METS=8,  EKG that was negative for ischemia in response to stress, and myocardial scans were within normal limits and did not show evidence of ischemia or infarction.  Cardiac ultrasound done 10/62 showed a normal left ventricular size and systolic function, no segmental wall motion abnormalities, and an EF of 62%.



Patient reports that she developed a cough approximately two weeks ago productive of white/tan sputum.  She also has nasal discharge that is yellowish in color.  Was evaluated at the urgent care clinic 5/20/66 no antibiotics were started.  Patient denies fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea.

CXR: clear

CT head: bilateral thalamocapsular infarcts

CTA: pending	

MRI/MRA:	pending

Assessment: 68yo RHM with history of bilateral thalamocapsular infarcts and multifocal stenoses of vessels of Circle of Willis, with prior symptoms of dysarthria, dysphagia, and gait instability, here in the setting of medication noncompliance, hypertensive and hyperglycemic, with 1 week of recurrent symptoms. Exam notable for absence of vertigo or nystagmus, as well as retropulsing stance and gait. Hyperglycemia and hypertension may well be exacerbating patient's prior deficits. However, cannot rule out possibility of a subacute infarct in the setting of plavix and antihypertensive discontinuation.

Plan:   

-     Check CTA to assess Circle of Willis

Check MRI brain stroke protocol

Control HTN, goal SBP ~160-180

Control hyperglycemia

If stroke present, admit to Neurology.

R/O MI



Discussed with Dr. Costello.

 

Thank you for this interesting consult.

PONTIAC INTERNAL MEDICINE ASSOCIATES          Sherman, Andrew
 
 
 
History of Present Illness:  The patient returns one week after being 
seen here initially in Internal Medicine clinic.  On the last visit he was having 
chest pain and was therefore sent to the Emergency Room for a further 
evaluation.  At that time he had EKGs which did not demonstrate any 
ischemia during his chest pain and a chest x-ray which was unremarkable.  
The Emergency Room physicians contacted his doctors at Humbert Hospital and obtained a history that the patient had a cardiomyopathy in 
the past with a decreased LV function.  However repeat echo within the 
past months demonstrated good LV function and they were in the process 
of performing further cardiac testing when the patient left the 
Humbert Hospital against medical advice.  After being evaluated in the 
Emergency Room at Pontiac State, he now returns to be tied in with 
the Internal Medicine clinic.  
 
Medications:  His medications since his Emergency Room visit include 
Carafate 1 gm. PO q.i.d., Prinivil 10 mg. PO q.d., Tenormin 50 mg. PO 
q.d., Motrin 600 mg. t.i.d. p.r.n. and Nitrostat tablets p.r.n.  His 
insulin dosing consists of 40 units of NPH q.a.m. and 18 units q.p.m. 
and regular insulin 20 units q.a.m.  
 
On return to my office today, he states that the frequency of his chest 
pain is much diminished but that he has gained some weight since 
discontinuing his Lasix per order of the Emergency Room physicians.
 
Physical Exam:  On exam, his blood pressure is 160/100 with a heart rate 
of 76.  He is not in any acute distress.  His chest is clear to 
auscultation.  His cardiac exam demonstrates S4 gallop and distant heart 
sounds.  His abdominal exam is benign except for massive obesity.  His 
rectal exam is guaiac negative.  His extremities exam demonstrates 1+ 
pitting edema to the shins and his neurologic exam is unremarkable.  
 
Assessment and Plan:  
 
1.   Cardiac.  The patient will be scheduled for an ETT thallium study 
     to rule out ischemia.
 
2.   Hypertension.  His Prinivil will be increased to 20 mg. q.d.
 
3.   Diabetes.  His sugars have been running 130 to 160 by fingerstick 
     checks at home and he will continue his present regimen.
 
4.   The patient will be referred to ophthalmology for the evaluation of 
     his eyes given his history of hypertension and diabetes.
 
5.   General.  The patient will see me shortly after completion of an 
     ETT thallium study for further discussion of his cardiac status.

Grandview, NE 13472                                      81376761
(552) 598-5590                                           05/29/73


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. Xian is 75 years of age. 
She has adult-onset diabetes, which in the past has required
treatment with insulin.  She has been managed with oral
hypoglycemics because of her reticence to using injections. 
She also has a history of CVA.

I last saw her in August of last year.  She was seen by Ms.
Vann, our nurse practitioner in early May.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Glipizide 5 mg two in the morning and
two in the evening, Plavix 75 mg one p.o. q.d., and Avandia
2 mg one p.o. q.a.m.  According to Ms. Vann's note of Apr
29, 2073, she is also supposed to be taking metformin 500 mg
one in the morning and two with the evening meal as was
prescribed back in 2072.  The patient and her son today are
not sure that she is taking this medication.  In fact, they
believe that she is not.  There has been moderate polyuria
and polydipsia.  Control of diabetes has been erratic. 
Hemoglobin A1c has been elevated.  On Apr 29, 2073, blood
glucose was 274, BUN was 25, creatinine 1.0, electrolytes
within normal limits as was calcium.  Cholesterol was 315. 
Hemoglobin A1c 10.6.  The patient has not experienced chest
pain, palpitations but she is moderately short of breath
when climbing stairs.  There has been no orthopnea and no
PND.  She denies dysuria and urgency and has not experienced
near syncope.  She denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and
constipation.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination today, she
appears well.  Blood pressure 122/66.  The heart rate is 90
and regular, weight 113 pounds, approximately five pounds
less than last year.  Random blood glucose was 224.

The patient suffered a minor CVA back in September 2071. 
She denies any recurrence of motor deficits or symptoms
suggestive of TIA.  The patient has a past history of
hyperthyroidism that was treated with iodine 131.  She has
not been hypothyroid since then.  In fact, the last TSH
level was 0.05 in August of last year, just prior to her
departure to Ghana.  She denies heat intolerance as well
as palpitations.

On physical examination, she is a small lady in no acute
distress.  The neck veins are flat.  The extraocular
movements are full.  There are no symptoms of
hyperthyroidism.  The chest is clear to auscultation.  The
heart sounds are regular.  There are no rubs or gallops. 
The lower extremities are free of edema and now her toes are
free of fungi but the nails are overgrown and require
attention.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  A 76 year old woman with a past
history of hyperthyroidism, which was treated with I-131
with good results who, last year before she left the
country, had a subnormal TSH.  She does not have obvious
symptoms of hyperthyroidism but today I have obtained a
repeat TSH as well as T3 and T4.

Diabetes continues to be a problem.  Glycemic control
continues to be difficult to achieve.  Today, I have
reinstated metformin at 500 mg p.o. q.d.  The son is going
to check on the medications to make certain that indeed she
is not taking this medicine at this point.  The other
medications were continued.  It is indeed possible that she
will need insulin in the near future.  I plan close followup
and will see her again in six weeks' time.  If she is
hyperthyroid, this may also explain the difficulty in
achieving glycemic control.  Against this is the high
cholesterol.  She used to be on Lipitor, which was
discontinued during her trip to Ghana.  I have
reinstated the Lipitor today 20 mg p.o. q.d.  I have also
added a small dose of enalapril 2.5 mg p.o. q.d. to protect
her kidneys even though she is not hypertensive.

She was en route to her normal dialysis session, and EMT took BP that was 80s/40s, brought to LCH ED for evaluation. Notably recently admitted to Santa Rosa on 9/10/2098 for hematemesis/hematochezia, but no intervention done. No report of recent GI bleeding. 



In ED, initial BP in 80s/30s, got 1.5 liters of IV fluid, came up to 90s/50s. Also was on 4-5 liters of oxygen with sat 95%. Blood and urine cultures sent, Vancomycin and Cefepime given. Daughter was contacted, who states patient is definitely DNR/DNI and no invasive interventions are to be done (including central lines, surgery, etc.) Bedside ultrasounds revealed known pleural effusions, pericardial effusion without signs of tamponade, and hypoechoic material in bladder suspicious for abscess/infection. CT abdomen done, was notable for bladder wall thickening potentially c/w cystitis, a new moderate sized pericardial effusion, and rectal wall thickening c/w proctitis. After CT, Foley placed with reported return of 400-500 cc of frank pus. Labs notable for K 5.0, BUN/Cr 39/4.02, WBC count 7.7. 



Patient seen in ED &#8211; BP 80s/40s, but arousable and able to answer simple questions. Denies any complaints, including pain, dyspnea, nausea, with one-word answers.



When daughter subsequently arrives, she confirms desire for no invasive procedures, lines, surgeries, or ICU level care. She does add that patient was at Levi Hospital two weeks ago, treated for &#8220;lung infection.&#8221; Uncertain of specifics.

MICROBIOLOGY

Blood and urine cultures pending



RADIOLOGY

Abdominal CT IMPRESSION: 

     1.  New moderate-sized pericardial effusion with pericardial 

     enhancement which may be due to pericarditis or pericardial 

     metastatic disease.

     2. Rectal wall thickening with fecal impaction, consistent with 

     proctitis, possibly due to venous stasis.

     3. Thickened urinary bladder wall with irregularity and enhancement 

     consistent with cystitis.

     4. Slight increase in moderate ascites since 4/2/98.

     5. Distended urinary bladder with unchanged bladder wall thickening.



Also noted are moderate bilateral pleural effusions. 



CXR: 

     IMPRESSION: 

     Pulmonary edema with large left effusion small right effusion.



TTE:

MITRAL VALVE                                                                    

There is calcification of the posterior mitral annulus.  There is no evidence

of mitral valve prolapse.  There is trace mitral regurgitation by color and

spectral Doppler.  There is a calcified papillary muscle tip.

                                                                                

LEFT ATRIUM                                                                     

The left atrium is elongated.  The antero-posterior left atrial dimension is 38

mm (normal range: up to 38 mm).  The medial-lateral left atrial dimension is 42

mm (normal range: up to 49 mm).  The superior-inferior left atrial dimension is

56 mm (normal range: up to 53 mm).

                                                                                

AORTIC VALVE, AORTA, LVOT                                                       

Multiple aortic leaflets are thickened but there is no stenosis.  The aortic

valve is tricuspid.  There is evidence of mild aortic insufficiency by color

and spectral Doppler.  The aortic diameter at the sinuses of Valsalva is 29 mm

(normal: less than 40mm).  The ascending aorta diameter above the sinotubular

junction is 28 mm (normal: less than or equal to 36mm).

                                                                                

LEFT VENTRICLE                                                                  

The left ventricular cavity size is normal.  The left ventricular systolic

function is within normal limits.  There is symmetric left ventricular

hypertrophy.  There are no obvious segmental wall motion abnormalities.  The

estimated ejection fraction is 66 %.  LVEF was measured by the single dimension

method.

                                                                                

TRICUSPID VALVE - IVC, SVC                                                      

There is color and spectral Doppler evidence of mild tricuspid insufficiency. 

The inferior vena cava is dilated. There is no phasic collapse of the IVC noted.

                                                                                

PULMONARY VALVE, INFUND., P.A.                                                  

There is evidence of mild pulmonary insufficiency by color and spectral

Doppler.  The RV systolic pressure was estimated from the regurgitant tricuspid

velocity (assuming an RA pressure of 10mmHg).  The estimated RV systolic

pressure is 41 mmHg.                                                        

RIGHT VENTRICLE                                                                 

The right ventricle is not dilated.  There is right ventricular hypertrophy. 

The right ventricular systolic function is within normal limits.                                                                  

INTERATRIAL SEPTUM, INTERVENTRICULAR SEPTUM                                     

There is no evidence of a patent foramen ovale by Doppler.                                                                                

PERICARDIAL DISEASE AND EXTRACARDIAC MASSES                                     

There is a small circumferential pericardial effusion.  There is no

echocardiographic evidence of tamponade.  There are intrapericardial fibrinous

strands.  There is evidence of a large pleural effusion.  There is ascites.                                                                       

CONCLUSIONS                                                                     

Compared to the study of 3/18/98, a small circumferential pericardial effusion

is now noted, and the measured RVSP has decreased (55 mm Hg previously). LVH

and RVH have appeared.



EKG: 

EKG reviewed &#8211; notable for low voltages, normal intervals, no significant ST changes compared to prior



ASSESSMENT &amp; PLAN



65F with colon cancer (but not candidate for intervention), CVA with residual speech/cognitive deficits, recurrent GI bleeds, HTN, p/w hypotension. Suspect likely UTI as source given frank pyuria. Can&#8217;t rule out SBP in setting of ascites and abdominal pain, but seems less likely. Does have bilateral pleural effusions, but these are chronic and without other signs of empyema, and small pericardial effusion with no signs of tamponade. Goals of care are decidedly conservative. 



Shock, likely 2/2 urosepsis: Foley placed, purulent material returned. Culture pending. Got Vanc 1 gm in ED at approximately noon, 2 gm cefepime at noon.

-continue cefepime 1 gm daily

-vanc 1 gm with HD

-consider diagnostic paracentesis tonight (daughter said this procedure seems reasonable), but would be of limited value given diagnostic only and more likely source of UTI

-with finding of proctitis on CT, will add IV flagyl 



Hypoxia, bilateral pleural effusions: on 4-5 L, suspect fluid overload as culprit

-could consider therapeutic thoracentesis if this would allow more aggressive fluid resuscitation, but should discuss with daughter first



ESRD: renal following, will consider HD tomorrow, pending labs/hemodynamics



h/o GI bleeds: hct seems stable without evidence for bleed as cause of shock, but follow Hct in AM



DM: SSI



HTN: holding anti-hypertensives



Goals of care: as above, no surgeries/invasive interventions/ICU level care



Med recon: PAML created from last discharge med list; have requested current med list from NGH, not yet received by fax



FEN:  

-boluses tonight as needed

-follow lytes

-NPO for now given mental status, active resuscitation



PPX:

-GI:  continue omeprazole if awake enough to take POs     

-DVT: subq heparin          

-BOWEL:  docusate/senna



Code Status:     DNR/DNI    (Discussed with patient&#8217;s daughter/HCP.)

Patient Name: WILHELM, GOLDY;  MRN: 9543443

Dictated at: 05/06/2092 by EDWARD XAYASANE, M.D. 



 

CHIEF COMPLAINT: Right leg pain and difficulty walking.   

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Wilhelm is a 68-year-old right-handed female who has had a three-week history of having right leg pain and difficulty walking. She states that her pain started about three weeks ago when she was bending and picking up a pot. She states she had a pain in her back that radiated around her right side down her groin into her medial leg, not past the knee. She states that it went away at that time. The next day she felt worsened and had difficulty working and saw her physician.  An MRI was ordered. Since then, she feels about 60-75 percent better. She states that her pain is constant and describes it as a sharp pain. She does state she feels weak and her knee would buckle. She does not have any numbness or tingling. She states she uses a walker to get to her bathroom, however, otherwise stays in the recliner. Her symptoms are increased with lying down and standing and decreased with sitting.  

 

Therapeutically, she has not received any physical therapy or occupational therapy. She is currently taking Darvocet, however, less frequently, and Celebrex for arthritis. Diagnostically, she has had an MRI scan in April 2092 that showed multi-level spinal stenosis, most prominent at L3/L4, especially on the right side, secondary to facet arthropathy and ligamentum flavum infolding, as well as possibly a mild disk bulge. Her mammogram was done in 2091 which was okay. She has not had a bone mineral density at this time.  

 

MEDICATIONS: Currently, the medication she is on is Celebrex, Hyzaar for her blood pressure, and Darvocet for her pain.   

ALLERGIES: She states that taking Tylenol With Codeine gives her toes a burning sensation, and ibuprofen causes tinnitus.   

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: She has got high blood pressure and shoulder arthritis.  

 

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: She had a left breast biopsy which she states was not cancerous.  

 

SOCIAL/FUNCTIONAL HISTORY: She is functionally currently not working. She is taking sick time. She has not worked for the past three weeks. She is a Head Nurse and worked at The Library Corporation for the last 35 years. She states her job is medium as far as intensity of work. Functionally, her activities of daily living are limited, and she uses an assistive device.  

 

SOCIAL HISTORY: She is widowed and she has four healthy children, ages 51, 50, 48, and 46. She does not smoke or drink.   

FAMILY HISTORY: She has aunts with diabetes and brother that had an myocardial infarction at 59.  

 

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: On review of systems, no fevers, chills, recent infections, bladder, thyroid problems, rash, shortness of breath, palpations, chest pain, nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, or bowel or bladder or sexual problems or urination difficulty.  She does have some joint pain and swelling in her shoulders and her feet occasionally. She does not have any numbness or tingling. She does have some trouble walking secondary to the pain. She does not feel fatigued and her appetite is okay and she does not feel anxious or stressed. She does have some mild trouble with sleeping, however, this has improved over the last few days.  

 

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On physical examination, well-developed, well-nourished, well-groomed, normal mood and affect, but slightly anxious with movement, female in no acute distress at this time. On musculoskeletal examination of lumbar spine, flexion was within normal limits. Extension she had her type of pain at about 10-20 degrees. Side-bending was unremarkable. On hip examination she had some decreased internal rotation on the right when compared to the left. Straight leg raise bilaterally was negative, however, supine, slight guarding on the right.  Femoral stretch was positive on the right but not on the left. On neurological examination, as far as motor examination, there is some slight decrease, half a grade, quadriceps and hip flexors; however, this was functional; otherwise unremarkable on the right or the left. Her reflexes were 2 plus in the achilles. Babinskis were downgoing, 1 plus at the patella on the right, and 2 plus on the left. Sensory examination slightly decreased at L3 on the right; however, normal throughout; otherwise, gait was antalgic on the right and she did not want to bear weight.  

 

IMPRESSION:  

1. Right L3 acute radiculopathy secondary to herniated disk and facet arthropathy.  

2. Functional limitations secondary to pain, causing her functional weakness.  

 

RECOMMENDATIONS:  

1. Transforaminal epidural steroid injection at L3 and L4 on the right.  

2. Physical therapy after her injection.  

3. Continue her medications of Darvocet and Celebrex.  4. Keep her out of work until she is able to receive the injection, as well as continue with her physical therapy to improve her strength, given her acute radiculopathy.   

The patient was seen and examined with Dr. Xayasane, who agrees with the plan above.

Patient: MARVINYANDELL,GRACE   [ 90468071(BHC) ]  FDate of Visit: 09/23/2104




Dear Dr. Mcfarland:


I had the pleasure of seeing Mrs. Marvinyandell at the Cardiac Laboratory in follow-up of her exertional dyspnea.

PHYSICIAN INTERPRETATIONFEV1 and FVC are reduced, FEV1/FVC is normal. There was not a significantresponse to inhaled bronchodilator. The reduced FVC is consistent with arestrictive deficit. Suggest lung volumes if clinically indicated. Since6/03/04, the FEV1 and FVC have not changed.








IMPRESSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS: DOE is likely multifactorial. It may be beneficial to separate cardiac from pulmonary limitatio from deconditioning and I recommended a cardio-pulmonary exercise test to the patient, to which she agreed. In addition, as previously discussed, she would benefit from pulmonary rehab. Finally, I am not sure how much asthma is contributing to the picture. There was no response to brnonchodialtor today and the patient does not feel any help from it either. I told her that she does not need to use albuterol if it doesn't help her. I've requested RAST allergy testing to further investigate the possiblity of allergic asthma. We will not do the methacholine challange testing due to patient's already deacreased FEV1 (due to restriction) as it might be dangerous to precipitate bronchoconstriciton in the setting of an already limited reserve.

RE:  Lara, Uriah
MRN: 62115644
 
Dear Dr. Eastman:
 
Thank you very much for referring Uriah Lara to the Georgia Regional.  He's a 51 year old male who approximately 2 weeks ago developed 
a pain and stiffness in his neck that limits his range of motion.  
Approximately 5 days ago he developed acute, severe and boring pain at 
the right trapezius and medial scapular that limits his ability to sleep 
and function.  Toradol, anti-inflammatory muscle relaxants and Percocet 
were of minimal help.  He had no other constitutional symptoms; fevers, 
rashes.  He had noticed some numbness and tingling down the right 5th 
finger and the pain would often travel down the outer part of the 
triceps region to the elbow and down to the right 5th finger.  He notes 
certain positions will alleviate the pain.  He then presented to a 
chiropractor on Saturday who manipulated his back, obtained x-rays which 
showed no abnormality.  Sunday, he received another manipulation and on 
Sunday night he was abdominal to sleep through the night.  This morning 
he states he had no pain in his neck, however, in mid-morning he did 
have recurrent pain.  He presents today for management treatment of his 
disorder.
 
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
 
MEDICATIONS:  Flurazepam 20mg. at night.
 
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  History is significant for repair of a right 
femoral compound fracture approximately 2 years ago and breast reduction 
surgery.
 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for pulmonary embolism after his 
orthopedic surgery.
 
SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient works as a pilot for Frontier Airlines.  He is married and has 3 children who are healthy.  He 
smokes a pipe.
 
FAMILY HISTORY:  He has one sister who has had a radiculopathy.  Mother 
is alive and well at 86.  Father died of an MI. 
 
Brit Eastman, M.D.

Page 2
 
 
 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination, blood pressure is 140/90.  HEENT 
examination was otherwise normal. Posture is somewhat stooped.  
Examination of the joints reveal deformity and swelling of the right 3rd 
PIP.  Has normal DIPs, PIPs, MCPs, wrists, elbows and shoulders.  Normal 
hips, knees, ankles and toes.  In the effected arm, he has normal elbow, 
normal triceps and biceps reflexes.  Normal brachioradialis reflexes.  
He has normal sensation in his hand.  He has weakness of the right hand 
intrinsic muscles and palpation in the medial muscle has felt an 
improvement in the pain. 
 
IMPRESSION:  Mr. Lara, I believe, has an acute radiculopathy of the 
a-cervical nerve.  I informed him that this will get better and that it 
was probably brought on by his antecedent muscle spasm.
 
PLAN:  We prescribed a neck collar, Indocin 50 TID, Flexeril 10 TID and 
I gave him additional Percocet.  I also prescribed a course of physical 
therapy with ultrasound and massage.
 
 
He will call me in one week and return in roughly 2 weeks.
 
Sincerely yours,

December 10, 2098  Endocrine/Diabetes



Present Illness:  

Asked to see this 89 year old patient of Drs. Pina and Keefe, admitted with an acute exacerbation of congestive heart failure in the context of severe aortic stenosis and less attention to diet at the time of his wife's death last week. He is approaching probable AVR and ? CABG. 



He has had diabetes since age 50. He was treated with diet initially, then chlorpropamide (100 mg bid at the time of admission) to which metformin (1000 mg bid at the time of admission) was added. His recent A1c was 6.5 %. He denies hypoglycemia and does not have hyponatremia. His creatinine is 1.5. He has never used insulin until this admission, when his oral agents were stopped and Lantus begun.

Retinopathy:	Reports that he does have retinopathy, but lost vision OD to macular degeneration. He is followed by Dr. Valentine and Dr. Wilkes, and reports that he has had laser treatment by Dr. Valentine.

Nephropathy:	BUN/Cr 42/1.5 

Neuropathy:	Decreased sensation in feet and hands. Notes that he has had flat feet all of his life and does not recall any acute painful episode in L foot.

Cardiac:	above

Vascular:	No claudication



Pre-op evaluation has included colonoscopy and EGD because of guaiac positive stool. An incidental bladder mass is suspected on the basis of pelvic CT and ? cystoscopy is also planned.



Past Medical History:  

Surgery:	Lymphoma - treated with surgery and radiation therapy in 2077 or so

	TURP

	Tonsillectomy

Medical:	Hypertension

	Anemia

	Asbestosis

	Pulmonary nodule

	Pulmonary fibrosis

	GERD

	Nephrolithiasis

	Depression

Allergies:	?? Sulfa - he thinks that he has had sulfa since the time he was labeled with an allergy to it but cannot recall details.	



Family History:  

MGF had diabetes.



Social History: 

His wife died last week of Alzheimer's Disease, several months following a fall.

He is a Financial Senior Manager. After the successful treatment of his lymphoma at about age 68, he went back to school to study sociology.



Review of Systems: above

Review of systems is otherwise negative.



Physical Exam:	

Delightful elderly man in no distress.

BP:   148/59		P:   64, regular

Wt:   165 by history, down from maximum of 235		Ht: 5' 10     by his estimate, down from 6' 1.5   

HEENT:	Anicteric. 

Fundi:	Not examined

Carotids:	2+,= with softly transmitted murmur

Chest:	cleat\retinopathy

Heart:	Normal S1; single S2..  No gallops.  3/6 systolic ejection murmur

Abdomen:	No hepatosplenomegaly. No masses. No tenderness. No palpable AAA. 

Extremities:	1+ ankle edema. Pop 1-2+ R, 1+ L. No pedal pulses.  R foot has small plantar arch, but L has no arch and bony prominence in the location of plantar arch; there is also some deformity of the  L ankle.            

Neurological:	AJ absent. 



Impressions and Plan:	

  	89 year old man with aortic stenosis, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure and longstanding type 2 diabetes.

  	His average control has apparently been good on the combination of chlorpropamide and metformin, although we cannot be sure of that in view of his anemia and the fact that he was not testing his glucose at home.

  	Metformin is relatively contraindicated since his GRF is certainly diminished with creatinine 1.5 at age 89. 

  	Lantus does not appear to be the right insulin for him. Would D/C it in favor of NPH 15 U in AM (watch carefully today since there is persistent Lantus effect). Check QID BS but cover with scale only before  breakfast and supper. I have not addressed the issue of long term insulin use with him, although it would be my first choice. Even at his age, I suspect that he would have no difficulty mastering it given his relatively youthful mind. Other alternatives would be sulfonylureas (if forced to use one, would choose glimepiride) and glitinides, for example repaglinide.



Thanks. Will follow.

Oncology COMPLETION NOTE 

Patient: Oscar Meyer  #277-14-47

RADIATION ONCOLOGIST: VICTOR M. ZUBIA, MD 

DATES OF RADIATION: 5/27/95 - 7/24/95 (58 elapsed days) 

DIAGNOSIS: Prostate adenocarcinoma T2B Nx,  Gleason 4+3 = 7,  PSA 7.1

CONCISE HISTORY: Mr. Meyer is a 63 year old man who was found to have an elevated PSA of 7.1 on screening exam. An abnormality was also noted on DRE at that time.  Prostate biopsy was performed, and all 12 cores were positive for disease, including 8 cores with Gleason 7 disease.  Prostatic MRI showed no evidence of extracapsular extension.  CT of the abdomen and bone scan revealed no evidence of metastatic disease.  He was treated with definitive radiation to the prostate and seminal vesicles by IMRT, with concomitant Zoladex treatment.

SPECIAL TECHNICAL CONSIDERATIONS: The patient underwent CT-based imaging to define the target volume and the normal tissue structures and 3D treatment planning was performed for treatment with IMRT. Daily localization of the prostate was done using the BAT ultrasound. 

SUMMARY OF RADIATION AND TREATMENT ADMINISTERED: The treatment site was the prostate gland plus the caudal seminal vesicles followed by a boost to the prostate alone. 

The patient underwent external beam radiotherapy to the prostate and caudal seminal vesicles to a dose of 45 Gy given as 25 fractions of 1.8 Gy/day. He then underwent a boost to the prostate only of 34. Gy given in 17 fractions of 2 Gy/day for a total dose of 79 Gy. 

CLINICAL COURSE: The patient developed mild nocturia and more frequent bowel movements, for which he took Flomax and Metamucil. Mr. Meyer has tolerated his androgen deprivation therapy well.

FOLLOW-UP: Mr. Meyer will follow up with us in 3 months with a PSA in advance.

PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN:
Roger L. Albright, M.D.
Columbia Kingwood Medical Center
57 Wood St, Q6-24
North Andover, KY  41454


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. Uhrich is a 73-year-old woman with past medical history notable for hypertension and dyslipidemia, but no coronary artery disease who presents with a three-day history of progressive weakness and lightheadedness.  The history is obtained in Spanish from the patient and through her daughter who assisted with translation.  In general, she has apparently been doing well with no episodes of chest discomfort or exertional dyspnea until roughly three days ago when she has began to notice episodic problems with walking even short distances before she feels as though she might pass out.  The episodes have occurred multiple times per day and after a particularly severe episode this morning, she brought her mother to the emergency department for evaluation.  There have been no syncopal episodes and no complaints of palpitations, orthopnea, PND, or lower extremity edema.  The patient has not had symptoms like this before and has been chronically treated with atenolol for hypertension for many years.


Her only cardiovascular evaluation has been with adenosine MIBI in 2085, which revealed normal systolic function and no evidence for ischemia.


PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Notable for hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, gastritis, and osteoarthritis.  She also carries the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus but is not currently treated for this.


MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Included amitriptyline 25 mg at bedtime, aspirin 81 mg daily, atenolol 25 mg daily, Lipitor 10 mg at bedtime, hydrochlorothiazide/lisinopril 25/20 one tablet daily, loratadine 10 mg daily, and Protonix 40 mg daily.


She developed gastrointestinal irritation with higher doses of aspirin.


SOCIAL AND FAMILY HISTORY:  As noted in the housestaff notes.


PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  In the Emergency Department, her heart rate is 38 beats per minute and her blood pressure is 110/70 mmHg.  Her venous pressures are low and there are BLANK waves present every other beat.  The chest is clear to auscultation and percussion bilaterally.  Cardiovascular exam reveals bradycardia with normal S1, wide physiologically split S2, and an audible S4.  There is no murmur.  The abdomen is soft and nontender.  The liver is not palpably enlarged.  The extremities are warm without edema.


Electrocardiogram reveals sinus rhythm with 2:1 AV block and right bundle-branch block.  There is left axis deviation consistent with left anterior fascicular block.


There is no response of her heart rate to mild calisthenics in the bed.


Laboratories are notable for normal BUN to creatinine ratio of 23/1.2 with a potassium of 4.1 and a hematocrit of 35%.  Initial cardiac biomarkers were negative.


In summary, Karson Uhrich is a 73-year-old woman with hypertension and dyslipidemia who presents with a three-day history of presyncope and weakness in the context of a new diagnosis of 2:1 AV block.  Review of previous electrocardiograms reveals no right bundle-branch block and left anterior fascicular block and of late this represents progression of her underlying conduction system disease.  We will proceed to permanent temporary pacemaker implantation for backup support and will arrange electrophysiologic consultation for permanent pacemaker implantation.  There is no history to suggest an ischemic syndrome, so I did not think additional pharmacologic stress test is necessary.  Her beta-blocker will be held overnight in addition to her amitriptyline to see if this facilitates recovery of her AV nodal function.  Overall, I think this likely represents infra-hisian block and a pacemaker should be curative therapy.  Additional plans will be dictated by her clinical course.

ID/CC: 64yoM with type II DM and HL p/w exertional SSCP, found to have lateral precordial/apical STDs


HPI:
Oscar Meyer is a 64yoM with type II DM and HL who has been having exertional, non-radiating, SSCP with activities such as shoveling snow and taking out the trash over the past several months, increasing in frequency.  He endorses 6 episodes over the last week, the most recent yesterday morning when he was shoveling.  The pain always resolves after 4-5 min of rest and deep breathing.  He denies n/v, palps, LH, and SOB but does have diaphoresis at times.  He presented to the SCH ED for evaluation today.


OSH course: The patient was hypertensive (max BP 200/89); he received Lopressor 5 mg IV x 2, resulting in BP 170/90; an additional 5-mg dose resulted in BP 160/87 (later, 146/79 just prior to transfer).  EKG showed small 0.5-1 mm STDs in V4-6.  Initial TnI was 1.00 (CK/MB wnl).  He received ASA 325, Nitropaste 1/2&#8221; (despite the fact that he takes Viagra at home), A heparin gtt was started (with bolus), and the patient was transferred to WPH in anticipation of cardiac cath.

Assessment:
64yoM with multiple cardiac risk factors p/w NSTEMI.

Ischemia: Plan for cath in a.m.  ASA, Lipitor, Lopressor, captopril, heparin gtt; tolerate up ACEI/B-blocker as tolerated.  Note that patient takes Viagra and therefore should ideally not have nitrates for CP, although he did tolerate Nitropaste at SCH; note that last dose of Viagra was Thursday, 11/29.  Serial EKGs and telemetry.  Will defer initiation of Integrilin until cath lab, as there is no clear benefit to starting now.  Need to check fasting lipids. 
Prolonged QTc: Etiology unclear, and no prior EKGs for comparison.  Will replete lytes for goal Mg=2, K=4. 
Pump: No ssx of CHF.  Will obtain post-cath TTE to assess for WMAs. 
DM: Holding orals while in house.  IVF with D5 while npo; cover FSBGs with RISS.  Will give Mucomyst and IVF for nephroprotection with cath. 
Ppx: Heparin.

FINDINGS



Ankle-brachial indices, segmental systolic pressures, and pulse volume

recordings are obtained at rest.



RIGHT:  ABI is .62.  Waveforms and pressures demonstrate SFA, popliteal,

and/or tibial vessel disease.  Perfusion is poor to the digit level.



LEFT:  ABI is .37.  Waveforms and pressures demonstrate iliac, SFA, popliteal,

and/or tibial vessel disease.  Perfusion is poor to the ankle, TM, and digit

levels.



Of note, multiple attempts were made to obtain toe pressures, however, this

proved to be technically impossible due to patient's constant twitching.



IMPRESSIONS:

1. RIGHT SFA, POPLITEAL AND/OR TIBIAL VESSEL DISEASE, WITH MODERATE ABI

REDUCTION, AND POOR DIGITAL PERFUSION

2. LEFT ILIAC, SFA, POPLITEAL AND/OR TIBIAL VESSEL DISEASE, WITH SEVERE ABI

REDUCTION, AND POOR PERFUSION TO THE ANKLE, TM, AND TOE LEVELS

3. TECHNICALLY UNABLE TO OBTAIN TOE PRESSURES





A/P:  This is a 85yo male s/p AVR, CABG with chronic pressure ulcerations at his soles bilaterally secondary to proximal disease. Recommend foot elevation when at rest, heel protection, specially-fitted shoes. 

Will D/W Dr. Quiring  for endovascular intervention.

General Examination
-------------------------------

6/08/2158 1:31 pm:  In his right arm,  his blood pressure was 100/42 and  his
pulse was 60 per minute  when lying; his blood pressure was 80/40 and  his
pulse was 64 rrr per minute  when sitting.  The orthostatic change was
symptomatic.  He appeared well-nourished and well-groomed.
6/08/2158 1:36 pm:  In his right arm,  his blood pressure was 90/40 when
sitting.

Rating Scales:
UPDRS Subscale III (Motor Examination):  Subscale total score was 22 out of
108.  This subscale was completed while the patient was ON.

Tremor at rest was rated on a 0 to 4 scale (with 0 being absent): 0 in the
face, 0 in the right upper extremity, 0 in the left upper extremity, 0 in the
right lower extremity, 0 in the left lower extremity,.

Action or postural tremor of the hands was rated on a 0 to 4 scale (with 0
being absent): 0 in the right upper extremity, 0 in the left upper extremity,.

Rigidity was rated on a 0 to 4 scale (with 0 being absent): 1 in the right
upper extremity, 1 in the left upper extremity, 1 in the right lower extremity,
1 in the left lower extremity,.

The following movements were rated on a 0 to 4 scale (with 0 being normal): 
    Finger Taps: 1 in the right upper extremity, 1 in the left upper extremity;
    Hand movements: 1 in the right upper extremity, 1 in the left upper
extremity;
    Rapid alternating hand movements: 1 in the right upper extremity, 1 in the
left upper extremity;
    Leg agility: 1 in the right lower extremity, 2 in the left lower extremity.

Each of the following was rated on a 0-4 scale (with 0 being normal):
    Speech:  1 (slight loss of expression, diction and/or volume);
    Facial expression:  1 (minimal hypomimia; could be normal 'pokerface');
    Arising from a chair:  1 (slow or may need more than one attempt);
    Posture:  1 (not quite erect, slightly stooped posture; could be normal for
older person);
    Gait:  2 (walks with difficulty but requires little or no assistance; may
have some festination, short steps, or propulsion);
    Postural stability:  1 (retropulsion, but recovers unaided);
    Body bradykinesia and hypokinesia:  2 (mild degree of slowness & poverty of
movement that is definitely abnormal; alternatively, some reduced amplitude).

Assessment:  
  1.  Parkinson's Disease:  Parkinson with decline in strength and endurance.
It is possible that the added  Sinemet is causing a decrease in his blood
pressure. I made a referral to Mary Darnell PT here at TMH. In addition Dr
Edward Nguyen felt a slight reduction of the Sinemet to 1.5 tab QID may help his
blood pressure with out changing his motor ability. RTC 1 month Dr Edward Nguyen
and 2 months Genevieve Noland, NP


Recommendations:

Medication given:
  Sinemet 25/100: 2 tab po qid.


Medication changes included:
   Stopped:
  pyridoxine 50 mg: 1 tab po qd;

  Sinemet 25/100: 1.5 tab po qid.

   Started:
  6/08/2158 Sinemet 25/100: 1.5 tab po qid.

This patient's history, physical examination, assessment and recommendations
were completed by  Genevieve Noland, NP.

She had an extensive workup in which it was unclear whether these represented a transient ischemic attack or partial seizures. She was started on Depakote for this. Between March and April of 2102 her Depakote was weaned because of a lack of interval seizures. EEG in January 2102 showed no evidence of epileptiform activity.   In July 2102 she had several episodes of loss of consciousness which ultimately were diagnosed as syncope. Dr. Keyes witnessed one of these events in his office in 7/02 and it was associated with hypotension.  

Ms. Yandell   s family describes her syncopal events differently, stating that she will stare into space for 5-8 minutes, during which time she is unresponsive.  When she    wakes up,    she is confused and sleepy for ~ 20 minutes and will often have nausea and vomiting.  These episodes are associated with jaw-clenching, but no tonic-clonic movements.  Ms. Yandell does state that she feels    dizzy and lightheaded    before these events, and reports that her family says she looks pale and clammy.  She does not recall the events herself.  The family does not report loss of bowel or bladder incontinence, although the patient did apparently lose continence of bowel shortly after being admitted (unclear circumstances surrounding this).  The family reports that EMS checked her blood sugar on the scene     it was normal.

In the emergency department, Ms. Yandell   s was afebrile,  82  158/70  18   95% on 2L.  She received zofran for nausea, ASA, and IVF, and was transferred up to the floor for further management. 

The patient denies that the episodes occur after she rises from a sitting position.  Do not occur when    bearing down,    or when she is exerting herself.  The episodes are not sudden     she appears to have some warning before one occurs.  She denies fevers/chills.  No chest pain, palpitations.  Some shortness of breath when walking, which sounds like it is unchanged.  Has had a cough for a few months and it is occasionally productive of ?color mucus.  She takes antihypertensive medications, but takes them as directed and by report does not group them together.

EKG: Sinus at 86.  Appears as though there is diffuse ST segment elevation, although when compared to EKG from >11/02, this appears unchanged.

CXR 7/28: NAD

Chest CT 4/03: 
IMPRESSION: Appearance of chest may be at baseline following
     right mastectomy with radiation therapy effect in right lung
     apex. Prior histoplasmosis infection could account for all of
     tiny lung nodules seen.

MRI 9/02
     Findings:  Diffusion weighted images show no evidence of acute
     ischemia.  There is susceptibility artifact in the region of the
     right posterior temporal bone which may be related to prior burr
     hole or craniotomy.  There are chronic appearing, small right
     cerebellar infarcts.  There are scattered periventricular FLAIR
     and T2 hyperintense white matter foci that are most consistent
     with small vessel ischemic change.  There is FLAIR hyperintensity
     in this sulci of the bilateral posterior frontal, bilateral
     parietal and left occipital lobes.  No abnormal enhancement is
     seen.  The brain parenchyma, ventricles and sulci are otherwise
     unremarkable.  The major intracranial flow voids are normal.
     There is a retention cyst in the left maxillary sinus.  There is
     partial opacification of the right mastoid air cells.  There are
     bilateral lens implants.  The bones, soft tissues and orbits are
     otherwise unremarkable.
     MRA:  There is signal dropout in the P2 segment of the right
     posterior cerbral artery.  There is diffuse irregularity of the
     proximal left posterior cerebral artery.  There is moderate
     stenosis of the left paraclinoid internal carotid artery.  The
     distal right vertebral artery is not well visualized.  There is
     otherwise normal flow related enhancement in the major vessels of
     the circle of Willis.
     Impression:
     Flair hyperintensity in the bilateral sulci with a posterior
     predominance as described.  This could represent hemorrhage, high
     protein content, high oxygenation or recent previous gadolinium
     injection.
     Signal dropout in the right posterior cerebral artery, consistent
     with severe stenosis with clot not excluded.  Diffuse irregularity
     of the left posterior cerebral artery.  These findings could be
     secondary to atheromatous disease in an older patient but
     vasculitis is another possibility.
     Moderate stenosis of the left paraclinoid internal carotid artery.
     No acute ischemia or mass lesion identified.
     Chronic right cerebellar infarction.
     Small vessel ischemic changes.

Carotid US 3/02
IMPRESSIONS:
1. RIGHT PROXIMAL CCA STENOSIS.
2. MINIMAL DISEASE OF THE RIGHT CAROTID ARTERY BIFURCATION.
3. MINIMAL DISEASE OF THE LEFT CAROTID ARTERY BIFURCATION.
4. BILATERAL ANTEGRADE VERTEBRAL ARTERY FLOW.

Echo    01
1.  Normal cavity sizes, wall thicknesses and global and regional right
    ventricular and left ventricular systolic function.  Left ventricular
    ejection fraction is in the range of 60%.  There is no flattening of the
    interventricular septum, asymmetric septal hypertrophy or evident right
    ventricular hypertrophy to suggest any appreciable elevation of pulmonary
    arterial pressure.  There is a reduced mitral valve diastolic Doppler E/A
    ratio, which may represent a reduced rate of left ventricular relaxation.
2.  There is fibrosis of the mitral annulus (very mild) and of the interannular
    fibrosa between the anterior mitral leaflet and the posterior aortic root.
    There are also some echodensities within the very proximal aorta which may
    represent atherosclerotic change. 
3.  The aortic valve is trileaflet.  Cannot fully exclude the possibility of
    some thickening of the bases of the aortic valve, but, alternatively, the
    increased echogenicity seen within the proximal aorta may represent
    atherosclerotic change of the aorta.  There is no evident aortic stenosis
    or aortic insufficiency.  Very mild mitral annular fibrosis.  Otherwise,
    the mitral valve appears structurally normal.  Normal appearing tricuspid
    and pulmonary leaflets.  There are signals of trace mitral regurgitation
    and trace tricuspid regurgitation.  Flow velocity could not be optimally
    assessed in the tricuspid regurgitant jet to permit accurate estimation of
    pulmonary artery systolic pressure.
4.  There is no evident pericardial effusion.


 
ASSESSMENT & PLAN:

1)  Syncope : Unclear etiology.  History from family sounds much more like seizure.  Episode in neurologist   s office sounds much more like orthostatic or vasovagal syncope.  Doubt arrhythmia given prodrome.  Doubt mechanical etiology given not related to exertion.
Continue MI rule-out
Repeat echo
Continue telemetry
EEG
F/u TSH
F/U UA / Ucx
F/U guiac
F/U neuro recs

2) Hx of clot- continue coumadin

3) DM     continue outpatient regimen, but hold for procedures

4) HTN     continue outpatient regimen, but hold for low BP

5) Hypothyroid     continue synthroid

6) Hx TIA     continue plavix

History of Present Illness	

Diabetes= on oral agents- just glyburide 5mg tab bid

Trying to keep diet - reviewed

Says sugars in range - tho again no diary.Tells me that sugars usually in acceptable range, tho once was 55. 

No other hypoglycemic episodes



no polyuria,polydipsia,no fevers, no weight loss

We talked again about bringing in his log- 

I suspect he is very out of range but dont know, and his report of sugars of 55 make me concerned about increasing meds.



Still having problems with ulcers - seeing Dr Ulbrich regularly

seeing nurse daily for dressing changes. Has heel pad to remove pressure. Has had shoes checked. Is to see Dr Ulbrich 's nurse today for debridement. Is off antibiotics now; was on ? a few weeks ago?? 



3. edema- good control recently

   taking zaroxylyn and lasix

   better controlled when on both

4. hypertension

  on  lisinopril, lasix. not on atenolol - he stopped it because he did not like it, made him feel sleepy. Need to consider increasing bp meds- will await Creatinine tpday

5. pulmonary hypertension

  not using his CPAP - did not like it  Discussed - advised to try again.we reviewed the whole issue of pulm hypertension/ leg swelling etc

Impression	

Diabetes. 

  on glyburide

 + evidence of visual changes(hemorrhage)- followed by ophthal

?  hypoglycemic episodes by hx.



 ?? adequately controlled on current regimen. Last A1C very high. If still high, I think he needs much more help getting in control. Since he sees nurse daily, will have to ask for her to check sugars, adjust meds after. 



 

2.  ulcers 

3. edema

  

4. hypertension not adequately controlled

  

5. pulmonary hypertension

6. Renal insuff- need to better control his sugars and bp

7 anemia  

8. Really overall not doing well. 



Plan	



1. Diabetes: will check A1C and sugar. Will contact VNA to begin sugars by VNA so we can try and control better. 

   

   reviewed meds - 

 reviewed vascular complications

 reviewed checking sugars and bringing in book

  

2. followup of ulcers on feet

 to see Dr Ulbrich. 



3. edema

 continue current combination of lasix and zaroxy. Check K, creat

4. hypertension

 check renal function - ? restart atenolol or add increase lisinopril

5. pulmonary hypertension

encourage cpap

6. anemia- check if elig for epo Could start at 40000u/week

Albertville, RI  87193                    39955317

(906) 517-8625                     03/16/2095





HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. Marsh is a 73-year-old male who comes for first visit to TRMC to initiate longitudinal care and follow up of multiple medical problems.



PROBLEMS:

1.  Chronic renal failure.  He has been on dialysis for the past four years.  He is currently dialyzed two times per week.  He apparently had been three times per week in the past.

2.  Hyperlipidemia.  Fasting lipid analysis one year ago showed total cholesterol 225, triglycerides 265, LDL 161, and HDL 40.  He has not been treated.

3.  Hyperparathyroidism.  PTH level one year ago was 143.  He is on calcium replacement.

4.  IgG monoclonal gammopathy.  This was noted on immunoelectrophoresis.  It was at very low levels.



MEDICATIONS:  Aspirin 81 mg q.d., Nephrocaps one q.d., and PhosLo 2001 mg t.i.d. by his report.



REVIEW OF SYMPTOMS:  He states he was told he was hypertensive at last dialysis. No significant weight change, febrile signs or symptoms, headache, blurred vision, tinnitus, chest pain, cough, shortness of breath, nausea, abdominal pain, nightsweats, diarrhea, skin rash, bruising, joint pain, or focal weakness.  



ALLERGIES:  No known allergies.



PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient appears well.  Blood pressure on multiple measurements range from 150-160/78-82, weight 144 pounds, and heart rate 72 and regular.  Chest: Clear to percussion and auscultation.  Cardiovascular exam:  No extra sounds or murmurs.  Abdominal exam:  No masses, tenderness, or organomegaly.  Extremities: No edema.  Skin: No rash.  Musculoskeletal exam: Grossly intact.



ASSESSMENT/PLAN:

1.  Chronic renal failure.  The patient will continue on dialysis.  I have requested screening blood tests.

2.  Hyperlipidemia.  This needs to be treated.  I have asked him to return for reestablishment of baseline.

3.  Hyperparathyroidism.  Secondary to chronic renal failure.  He is on calcium replacement.

4.  Low-grade IgG monoclonal gammopathy. Will recheck values and follow.

5.  Hypertension.  A degrees systolic hypertension warrants therapy.  He is due for dialysis tomorrow, however.  I gave him a prescription for atenolol 25 mg p.o. q.d.

6.  Adult health maintenance.  I gave him a prescription for aspirin, which he should be taking and asked him to return in two weeks for a full annual review.

  I instructed him to show renal staff the prescriptions tomorrow at dialysis.

PCP: Paul Eggleston

Cardiology: Youmans



CC: emesis, light-headedness 



HPI: 85 y/o with CAD and active ischemia on 6/87 stress test (medically managed) who was feeling well until last night.  During the day yesterday, he went on his daily walk with his wife and felt fine.  In the evening around 8:30 pm, he experienced dull, 8/10 pain under both arm pits which resolved within 20 minutes after taking 3 SL TNG 5 mins apart.  He denies SOB, N/V, radiation or diaphoresis associated with this arm pain.  He states that he gets similar bilateral underarm pain about twice per week which is usually relieved by a single SL TNG within 10-15 mins.  The arm pain is not exertional.

	After the arm pain relieved last night, the pt took 3 Aleve tabs which his daughter bought for him for arthritis pain.  A couple of hours later, he became nauseated and had a single episode of    dark brown    emesis.  After vomiting, he felt light-headed while walking around the house.  He had a bowel movement this AM which he states was darker than usual, almost black looking.  He denies BRBPR, abdominal pain, CP, SOB, palpitations, headache, fever or chills.

	In the setting of significant fatigue and light-headedness, the pt presented to the ED this morning.  Admission vitals: 97.2, 120/78, HR 80's, RR12, sats 97% RA.  He was noted to be in A fib.  Hct was 22 (down from 38 last week).  NG lavage was not performed in the ED.  However, he did have another episode of bilateral arm pain which was relieved by SL TNG x 3.  HR at the time of arm pain was in the 80's and ECG showed A fib with possible TWI in I,L and V6 but relatively unchanged from admission ECG without pain.  He subsequently received lopressor 2.5 IV/12.5 PO, isordil 10 PO and zantac 50 IV.

Studies:

EKG  AF (92) LAD TWI I,L,V6

CXR  IMPRESSION:

	There are linear opacities at both bases consistent with

	subsegmental atelectasis. Bilateral calcified pleural plaques are

	consistent with asbestos exposure. There is no pneumothorax. No

pleural effusions are visualized.  There is extensive change including both shoulders.



Assessment:  85 y/o with medically management multivessel CAD who presents with light-headedness, fatigue and anemia.  Likely coffee gound emesis, melana and increased BUN concerning for UGIB.  Given history of alcohol consumption (suspect that consumption may be slightly more than given by history) and NSAID use, gastritis is a possibility.  No clear reason for other sources of UGIB.  Pt also found to be in Afib of unknown duration.  Unclear if Afib was prompted by anemia due to UGIB.



Plan:



1.	UGIB

a.	Active blood back sample, IV access

b.	Hct increased from 22.2 to 24.7 after 2u pRBCs.  Given CAD history, will transfuse one more unit

c.	GI consult for possible EGD (pt likely also needs colonoscopy given h/o tubular adenoma)

d.	IV zantac 

e.	Hold aspirin for now

2.	CV

a.	Ischemia - TVI on admission on ECG from ED.  Will cycle cardiac enzymes.  Hold aspirin for now given GIB.  Continue beta blocker both for ischemia protection and AF rate control; will hold other anti-hypertensives for now

b.	Rhythm - unclear duration of Afib so immediate cardioversion not an option (avoid TEE in the setting of UGIB); lopressor for rate control; no anticoagulation for now; central telmetry

c.	Pump - no active issues 

3.	increased WBC 

a.	unclear etiology ? reactive

b.	Afebrile, no signs of infection; will follow

4.	diabetes

a.	SSI

PRESENTING COMPLAINT and HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  This 
patient was evaluated in conjunction with a resident.  Briefly, the 
history is as follows:  This patient is a 54-year-old black male 
with a history of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, who presents 
with acute, severe substernal chest pain.  This pain began 
approximately five hours prior to presentation, but accelerated 
within the previous one to two hours.  It is accompanied by 
diaphoresis, but not by shortness of breath or nausea.  The patient 
does have a history of prior CVAs, but no history of previously 
documented cardiac disease. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination, the patient is in 
acute, severe distress.  He is diaphoretic and somewhat pale.  The 
vital signs are as recorded in the Nurses' Notes but are stable 
initially.  The HEENT examination shows the sclerae to be 
anicteric.  The oropharynx is somewhat dry.  The neck is supple, 
without venous distention.  The breath sounds are clear 
bilaterally.  The heart shows a regular rate and rhythm with 
somewhat distant tones, without discrete murmur.  The abdomen is 
slightly obese and soft throughout, without tenderness.  The 
extremities show no discoloration or edema. 
LABORATORY EVALUATION:  The electrocardiogram shows an acute 
anterior myocardial infarction.  Other laboratory studies are 
pending at this time.  A chest x-ray has been obtained, though it 
has not been processed at the time of this dictation. 
THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  The patient was treated with 
aspirin and nitroglycerin en route.  He was started on a 
nitroglycerin drip, which was incrementally increased to 80 
micrograms per minute.  He was given morphine sulfate in 2 mg 
increments to a total of 10 mg.  He was given 5000 units of 
intravenous heparin.  He was given 2.5 mg of intravenous Lopressor. 
The Cardiology Service is here with the patient and he is being 
taken to the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory for immediate 
angioplasty. 
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  Myocardial infarction. 
DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  As above. 
Please see the handwritten record for further details.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 


Mr. Austin is a 78 year old Ecuadorian gentleman with known Diabetes and history of cerebellar CVA but no HO CAD who returned from Ecuador 2 days ago.  He left Angels City after I saw him in January when he was free of angina.  While taking an afternoon walk in Quito during early June he experienced fairly severe mid-sternal pain without diaphoresis; pain radiated  to the left upper arm and patient discribed it  as ""sharp burning pressure"".  He went back home and rest releived the pain he estimates within 15 minutes. There days later pain reccurred, again it lasted about 15 minutes but this time he went to ED.  An EKG was ""normal"" and he was discharged on NG. Approximately one week later he experienced another episode of CP similar to the previous ones, he was taken to another hospital and he was hospitalized. On July 1st he was catheterized and found to have ""diffuse CAD"" involving several vessels. Stent placement was not attempted. His LV EF was 55% and he was transferred to a medical ward. A day later, on July 3rd, he was readmitted to the ICU because of CP; he was stabilized and eventually discharged on July 5 on the following medication: 


ASA 81 mg
Plavix 75 mg po qd
Bisoprolol 5mg po qd
Isosorbide 20 mg one po in am 1/2 po in pm
Ranitidine 300 mg po qd
Lipitor 40 mg po qd
A sleeping medication 3 mg ?Lexotan one po hs
Metformin 1000 mg po bid


Mr. Austin has been pain free since his discharge until today when he was readying himself to come to the hospital. He then  experienced a brief episode of pain in mid sternum without radiation to the left shoulder which had been present during previous episodes. It is worth noting that ETT here  in 2091 was suggestive of CAD but stress echocardiogram was  was read as not suggestive of ischemia:


Testing performed:  STRESS ECHO, DOPPLER, COLOR DOPPLER     M-Mode:        2D Quality: Conclusion:     1.  Patient exercised  6 min 20 sec on a standard Bruce treadmill protocol,    reaching stage 3, and stopped secondary to fatigue.  No chest pain was    reported.  Maximal heart rate attained was 123 bpm (84% of maximum HR    predicted for age), and BP at peak exercise was 154/68.    The maximum    rate-pressure product was 18,942.2.  See exercise report for full ECG details.        Baseline resting ECG is normal sinus rhythm.      There were 1 mm horizontal/upsloping ST depressions in leads V3-6 and      lead II at peak exercise.3.  Baseline resting echocardiogram reveals:         Normal left ventricular size and systolic function.  Estimated resting       ejection fraction is 60%. No resting segmental wall motion       abnormalities.       Trace mitral regurgitation.4.  Echocardiographic images obtained immediately following peak exercise    reveal:      Normal increase in overall systolic function, with an estimated ejection      fraction of &gt;80%.      All segments augment normally, without inducible wall motion      abnormalities.SUMMARY:  No echocardiogrphic evidence of infarct or inducible ischemia, atslightly less than target heart rate (which decreases the sensitivity of thisexam).ATTENDING STAFF:        WINSTON,LATASHA V.,M.D.,PH.D.
  
Mr. Austin has  Type II diabetes on oral hypoglycemics and h/o CVA in 2090 which resulted in right hemiparesis (now fully resolved) who was last seen in January.  At that time he denied any symptoms suggestive of angina.   


Glycemic control ahs been variable.  Last HGBA1C in 11/85 was 7.8.  Lately there has been an increase in fating levels.  Today BG 162. Last week 112 at home. He is no longer exercising.  Has nocturia X2 but without dysuria. Denies polyuria, polydipsia, nause, chills and fever. Appetite normal. 


 He has residual right shoulder pain after a fall in Dec 2094 which was significantly improved by  steroid injections. Episode of bilateral low-pitched  ringing in his ears has abated. Uses two pillows. No PND, orthopnea and leg edema. Denies vision changes. .  Denies episodes of light-headedness or vertigo.  


PMHx:
H/O diabetes mellitus type 2 : h/o poorly controlled diabetes, which improved and then deteriorated. 

Cataracts. He was seen by Ophthalmology and was told insurance does not cover cataract surgery which he needs. 
 


Vital Signs
BP 125/65, P 64, Temp 95.7 F, Wt 144 lb




GEN: well-appearing, thin elderly gentleman
HEENT:  Hazing of left lens, no arcus senilis. PERRLA

EXT: WWP. Pedal pulses 2+ bilaterally. No evidence of foot ulcers or calluses
, multiple varicose veins.




ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  
A 78-year-old gentleman with a history of adult-onset diabetes and CVA who has new onset of exertional angina who was catheterized in Quito 2 weeks ago. Findings:  difuse, severe multi vessel disease weith well preserved LVF. 


LAD: Critical stenosis 95% at origen and bad distal bed
LCX obstructed disttally Good marginal obtuse branch with 90% stenosis med-proximal

Robert J. Trujillo, M.D.

Department of Vascular Surgery

Galena, MN  64864

 

Dear Dr. Trujillo:

 

Thank you for referring Mrs. Shirley Trent, a 68-year-old lady

with peripheral artery disease, on whom you plan to do

revascularization of the right leg.  Her history is well known to

you but I will repeat it for our records.  She has a long history

of cigarette smoking with a 3-packet-per-day history for 30

years, stopping 15 years ago.  She has developed claudication,

particularly in the right leg, over the last year since her

husband died, which has all the typical symptoms and is relieved

by rest.  This seems predominantly in the right calf but is also

in the right thigh as well.  She had segmental leg pressures done

which shows some mild diminution in the left leg but an

ankle-brachial index of 0.65 in the right leg.  An MR angiogram

showed stenosis, although I do not have the full report on this

as yet.

 

She has intercurrent problems with insulin-dependent diabetes

mellitus, which she has had for 10 years.  Her other cardiac risk

factors apart from cigarette smoking include a family history of

myocardial infarction in her father, and it is uncertain what her

cholesterol level is.  She has no history of hypertension,

although I am uncertain whether this has been checked in the

past.  She has a past history of partial gastrectomy in 2059 for

a bleeding peptic ulcer and this has led to some difficulty in

swallowing tablets and keeping them down.  She also has a past

history of a right middle lobectomy in 2079 for adenocarcinoma

that had clear margins and did not require further adjunctive

therapy.  She also had a cholecystectomy in 2079, which was

uneventful.

 

Systems review reveal no chest discomfort, dyspnea, ankle edema,

palpitations, syncope, cough, sputum, hemoptysis, GI bleeding,

weakness down the arms, face, or legs, seizures or visual

disturbances, and all other systems are negative.

 

She lives alone, and her current medications include insulin

only.  She has no allergies.

 

On physical examination, she is alert and orientated without any

signs of jaundice, clubbing, or cyanosis.  Her heart rate was 85

beats per minute with a blood pressure of 160/85 in both arms. 

The jugular venous pressure was not elevated, and her carotid

upstrokes were reduced, but she had no bruits audible.  Her apex

beat was not palpable, and she had a normal first and second

heart sound without added sounds, murmurs, or gallops.  Her chest

was clear to percussion and auscultation.  She had no

hepatosplenomegaly and no abdominal masses or pulsations.  She

had the scars from previous operations present.  Her femoral

pulses were absent on the right side and reduced on the left side

without bruits.  She had reduced but palpable dorsalis pedis and

posterior tibial pulses on the left leg but no pedal pulses on

the right leg.  There were no trophic changes in her legs.  She

had reduced sensation to pinprick in both feet to the mid calf

level in a stocking distribution.

 

Her ECG showed sinus rhythm without abnormalities.

 

Assessment:  This lady obviously has severe claudication and

requires revascularization, but is uncertain whether she has any

myocardial ischemia.  I therefore think a stress test is

required.  She also has difficulty in swallowing medications and

this will prove a problem for the long-term management of her

atherosclerosis, which I would like to further evaluate.

 

Plan:  I therefore organized a dobutamine stress test to assess

for myocardial ischemia and cardiovascular risk.  I have also

asked her to start on a small dose of a beta-blocker for reducing

her perioperative risk as well as treating her blood pressure,

which is elevated.  I have also asked her to have a fasting blood

lipid test today so we can assess her cholesterol level, as it is

likely that she would benefit from lipid-lowering therapy.  I

plan to evaluate all these in approximately a month or so after

her operation so that we can manage her in the long term.

 

I will let you know the results of her stress test when they

become available.  Thank you for allowing me to take part in this

lady's care.

 

Yours sincerely,

  Return visit.
  
  Reason for visit:  A 71-year-old male for comprehensive eval/management of multiple
  issues.
  
  Problems:  
       1.   Diabetes:  Continues on oral agents since 2087.  A1C is below 7.0 at goal. No
       hypoglycemia.  Fasting sugars less than 130 on balance.  Has regular follow up.
       2.   Hypertension:  Blood pressure well controlled on valsartan.  Cardiac ultrasound
       2111 with normal ejection fraction, no LVH and normal mitral regurg.  Continue
       current program.
       3.   Coronary artery disease:  Patient had mildly abnormal stress test with moderate
       posterior ischemia in 2112. This was done due to exertional shortness of breath.
       Those symptoms have essentially resolved. He has never used nitroglycerin.  He
       has gone through the cardiac rehab program. Now put on beta blocker due to
       patient's preference. No strong indication given. No MI or symptomatic angina.
       4.   Hyperlipidemia:  Tight control of lipids achieved on Zocor.  LDL less than 100.
       5.   Stroke: Status-post stroke 2111 with slurred speech and left facial droop.
       Warfarin recommended for one year at that time for presumed cardiac embolus. 
       Considered discontinuing this visit.  
       6.   Anemia: Patient has had a mild hyperproliferative anemia.  Has been seen by Dr.
       Barr.  This has remained stable.  Bone marrow biopsy nondiagnostic.
       7.   Hypogonadism:  Patient has been evaluated by Dr. Dominique Stokes.  Placed on
       AndroGel 2111.  Testosterone levels have improved.  Question if that has
       improved his fatigue and anemia.
  
  Review of systems:  He does have sleep apnea on CPAP.  Has bilateral hearing loss on
  audiogram. Has some peripheral edema on occasion.  Have recommended support
  stockings.  Urinalysis today showed greater than 100 red blood cells and he said this was
  due to penile trauma from tight shorts.  We will repeat this.  He did see blood that day. 
  He has never seen it since.  He has multiple seborrheic keratoses including on his penis. 
  He will see Field Crest Care Center.  Otherwise ROS is negative.  
  
  Family history:  Mother died of cancer in her 80's of unknown primary.  Father died of
  stroke in his 80's.  
  
  Physical exam:  Weight was 197.  Baseline 190.  Max 210.  Goal 185.  Blood pressure
  was 140/78.  Pulse 60.  Skin:  normal.  HEENT:  pupils equal and reactive to light. 
  EOMs full. Fundi normal. Mouth clear.  Neck: JVP6.  Carotids 2+ without bruit.  Thyroid
  normal.  Nodes:  none.  Chest:  clear lungs.  Cardiac:  S1 and S2 normal.  Grade II/VI

   Cardiology Admit Note


	Interval History:
   Primary cardiologist: Jan Ivory (Kevin Mcdaniel)

61 y/o M with h/o CAD admitted for CP.

Cardiovascular history notable for:
- Nov 34 - acute IMI; cath (11/08/34) LM, LAD and large Ramus with minimal disease, LCx with tandem 70% and 50% stenosis in non-dominant vessel, distal RCA with 90% stenosis and mid and distal PLV with tandem 80% lesions; Rx: Vision 2.5 x 15 to distal RCA, Minivision x 2 (2.5 x 15 each) to mid and distal PLV
- echo (11/08/34) EF 54%, overall unremarkable
- last ETT-MIBI (2/23/35) 7:10, 9 METs, 80% mphr, pkdp 19k, developed chest pain (different from presenting) at 7 mins, ECG negative to HR attained, images without ischemia or infarction, EF 68%

He has done quite well from a cardiac perspective since the MI.  He has occasional fleeting chest pain but never sustained and nothing in the past 1-2 months.

He awoke this AM with dull left chest pain which has persisted throughout the day.  Pain was 6/10 at worst, unchanged with exertion and similar in quality (albeit less intense) to pain during STEMI.  No associated SOB, nausea, diaphoresis or radiation.  Given the CP persistance, he presented to the ER.  Initial ECGs showed sinus brady with a relatively normal tracing; no acute ischemic changes and no significant change from prior.  After a combination of 4 SL nitro, IV nitro, IV heparin and morphine (2mg IV x 2), the CP eventually subsided.  

Currently, he is CP free and resting comfortably.  At baseline, he doesn't exercise formally but he has 3 flights of stairs at home and he's able to climb them without exertional symptoms.  Also, he was previously on therapy for GERD but stopped taking prilosec several months ago.    


	Past medical history:
   - CAD - as above
- HTN
- hyperlipidemia
- DM2 - no known microvascular disease; last A1c 7.3 (June 36)
- Ankylosing spondylitis
- h/o thrombophlebitis (vs DVT) of left leg
- hemorrhoids s/p banding

Home meds: ASA 81, lipitor 20, metformin 500, zestril 10, toprol 25

	Other Data:
   PA/lat CXR - LLL opacity 


	Assessment and plan:
   61 y/o M with h/o CAD p/w CP.  Some features are concerning for angina (similar to prior symptoms, some improvement with nitro...), whereas other aspects are less concerning (prolonged CP without ECG changes or biomarker leak).  Overall, doubt ACS.

In terms of subtle LLL opacity on CXR, doubt PNA given lack of cough, sputum or  fever...He has mild leukocytosis (normal differential) of unclear etiology.

Plan:
- cycle troponins
- continue IV heparin overnight
- if biomarkers negative and no recurrent CP, would favor ETT-MIBI in AM for further risk stratification
- continue home meds
- hold metformin, in case cath required
- repeat CBC with diff in AM, check U/A

SCHLESWIG COUNTY CLINIC
Walk-in clinic
24 Weld St
Grandview, NE  13472

Xian, Imogene
64187177
07/30/72

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Ms. Xian is a 75-year-old female who presented 
to the walk-in clinic this evening as a walk-in with a chief 
complaint of bilateral foot pain especially in the toe area, and 
she says that this has been going on for approximately two 
months.

ALLERGIES:  She denies any known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS:  At present, she is taking Glucophage 500 mg one 
p.o. q.a.m, two p.o. q.p.m., Avandia 2 mg one p.o. q.a.m., Plavix 
75 mg one p.o. q.d., glipizide 5 mg two p.o. q.a.m., and two p.o. 
q.p.m., and Lipitor 20 mg q.d.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  The patient states that she has had constant 
pain in her toes and at times with a feeling of tingling.  
Otherwise, she states she has been feeling well.  She denies any 
chest pain or heart palpitation.  She denies any shortness of 
breath.  She denies any nausea, vomiting or diarrhea.  She denies 
any frequency, dysuria or thirst.  She has a history of non-
insulin-dependent diabetes at this time.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Her temperature was 98.5 degrees p.o., her 
pulse was 80, her blood pressure was 118/60 in her right arm.  
Her weight was 117 pounds, which reflects a one-pound weight loss 
since her last visit.  Her blood sugar, which was random, was 
159, her last meal being at 12 noon.  Her son, who accompanied 
her states that it is questionable whether she is taking her 
medications as instructed and voiced an interest in having his 
mother take insulin, which she has taken in the past.  Her heart 
had a regular rate and rhythm at 80.  There was no evidence of 
any peripheral edema.  Examination of her toes revealed presence 
of some tinea interdigitally.

ASSESSMENT:
1.  Non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, moderate control.
2.  Tinea pedis.

PLAN:  Medication refills were given for Glucotrol 5 mg dispensed 
No. 120 with two refills, two p.o. q.a.m., two p.o. q.p.m., 
Glucophage 500 mg No. 90 one p.o. q.a.m., two p.o. q.p.m., and 
Avandia 2 mg No. 30 with two refills one p.o. q.a.m., and a new 
prescription for Lotrimin AF 1% cream dispensed 12 g with one 
refill, apply to the affected area b.i.d. for up to four weeks.

RE:  		Isabelle Y. Quick

ATCH: 		655-75-45



Dear Harry and Yair:



My thanks for your kind referral of the above noted patient with respect to her disabling claudication and of course she is not in a very happy circumstance.  As you know, she is just 52 years of age.  Her cardiovascular risk factors include type 2 diabetes treated with metformin and Glyburide, hypertension, hyperlipidemia and she is a former cigarette smoker but she has not smoked in a year.  She spends a lot of time caring for her partially disabled husband.  She has known and impressive history of peripheral vascular disease.  She has undergone bilateral leg revascularizations.  On the left side initially an iliac stent was tried but in January of 2063 she had a left iliofemoral endarterectomy with angioplasty and in situ above knee left fem-pop bypass graft.  This reconstruction is functioning well, as evidenced by pulse examination and she certainly does not have any major symptoms in the left side.  In April of 2063 she had a right common femoral and external iliac endarterectomy with a right fem-pop bypass graft to the above-knee popliteal artery using transposed greater saphenous veins.  There had previously been a right iliac PTA and stent.  She states that the procedure in the right leg was only transiently of benefit.  By last spring, i.e. a year ago she again had rather limiting claudication.  She says this is now worse over the past several months and she quantifies this as severe calf pain after just a couple of blocks.  Importantly she does not have ischemic rest pain and she has never had tissue loss.  Recently resting ABIs were recorded at 0.46 on the right and 0.8 on the left.  Her continued complaints led to a repeat arteriogram last October documenting a superficial femoral artery occlusion (??? length thereof - she did not bring the films themselves) and a patent albeit small reconstituted above-knee popliteal artery with decent runoff.  Understandably Dr. Adcock was reluctant about recommending further revascularizations.  She has sought an opinion here in this regard.  She has no known coronary artery disease and her general system review is notable for a prior hospitalization in 2061 for severe pancreatitis requiring laparotomy.  On physical examination blood pressure was 140/80.  Pulse was 70 and regular.  Carotid upstroke was normal and there were no major carotid bruits.  She has femoral pulses on both sides and the left fem-pop bypass graft in situ is palpable, as is the left popliteal pulse.  There is no right popliteal nor right foot pulse.  She does have dependent rubor on that right side although there is no tissue breakdown.



This is of course a very unhappy situation.  Further attempts at surgical revascularization in the setting of having both greater saphenous veins harvested and so forth is really not justified for claudication alone since the result can be anticipated to be not very good.  However I am not absolutely ruling this out.  I would suggest the following.  Her risk factor control is decent and she should certainly stay on the Lipitor, aspirin and Plavix.  Since her problem is claudication I would like Yair to institute Pletal at full dosages and give this at least a couple of months before we can say that she has had an adequate trial with question benefit.  She will get the actual arteriogram from the October study to me.  If it seems reasonable and the right superficial femoral artery block is not too long an attempt at percutaneous recanalization could be considered.  I will get back to you after review of the films themselves.  My thanks once again.  With every best wish.



Sincerely,





Daniel W. Iniguez, M.D.

Vascular Surgery Admission Note



Patient Name:  Quick, Isabelle

MRN:  6557545

Date and Time: 8/02/65 2:40PM

Attending: Dr. Iyer

Fellow: Dr. Wade

Junior Resident: Dr. Joyce



cc: thrombosed R fem-pop BPG; increasing rest pain in R leg



HPI:  The patient is a 53 year old woman with a past medical history of diabetes, HTN, and PVD s/p L fem-pop BPG with in-situ vein 2063, R fem to AK pop BPG with GSV 2063, R fem-BK pop BPG with propatent graft 9/17/64, and multiple attempts at angiographic intervention who presents with worsening rest pain in the R leg X 1 month.  



Immediately following her 2nd R fem-pop BPG in 9/2064, she felt well and without significant LE pain.  Over the past month, however, the patient reports that she has had progressive pain in her R foot and leg, which wakes her up from sleep almost every night.  She can walk less than one block without disabling claudication which improves with rest.  She also has noticed discoloration of her R foot, along with numbness and paresthesias, which have been progressive over the same time period.  



She denies all symptoms other than RLE pain and claudication as described.  Specifically, she denies chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, headache, and fevers/chills.  She reports that her left leg is occasionally painful, although it has been tolerable in comparison to her R leg.  She has been taking aspirin and plavix regularly, but has not taken coumadin for 2 days (last dose 7/31/65).  



She last underwent arterial LENIs on 7/17/65, which demonstrated critical ischemia in her R leg and a thrombosed R fem-pop BPG (see below for official report).  She is admitted for elective revascularization of her R leg.

                                              7-21-79
 
 
 
History of Present Illness:  Mr. Sherman is a patient well known to 
me.  I have seen him on multiple occasions for his coronary artery 
disease, hypertension, and diabetes.  The patient has had a positive 
exercise tolerance test recently and was seen by Cardiology who felt 
that he should undergo cardiac catheterization.  However, patient was 
overweight and the decision was made for him to reduce his weight by 
approximately 50 lb. at which time he would be suitable for cardiac 
catheterization on the Pontiac equipment.  Patient was seen last night 
in the Pontiac Emergency Room with a several day history of back pain 
which began in the middle of his back and has subsequently become right 
flank pain which is persistent and colicky in nature.  
 
On exam in the Emergency Room he was noted to be afebrile.  His exam was 
notable for CVA tenderness and an exam highly suspicious of renal colic.  
His EKG was unremarkable and his laboratory exam was unremarkable as 
well.  His urinalysis did not demonstrate any red blood cells, however, 
did have 3+ uric acid crystals with a normal uric acid blood level.  An 
abdominal ultrasound was ordered which was unremarkable except for the 
presence of his slight abnormality in the right pole of a kidney.  IVP 
was recommended by the radiologist for follow-up.  He was given Toradol 
in the Emergency Room with minimal improvement and sent home with some 
Motrin with the follow-up to be by me in Internal Medicine Clinic.  I was called by 
the patient this morning complaining of worsening pain in his right 
flank.  On it, patient states he is unable to get out of bed and was 
brought to the Pontiac State Hospital to my Internal Medicine Clinic.  On exam 
he was afebrile and his exam was notable for a right CVA tenderness with 
pain radiating around to his abdomen and exacerbated by pushing on his 
abdomen.  Patient has good bowel sounds throughout and there are no 
peritoneal signs.
 
Assessment and Plan:  While I am concerned about his possible renal 
pathology I believe that there is a significant chance that this may be 
musculoskeletal in nature, however, due to his other medical problems I 
feel that an intravenous pyelogram is definitely indicated and he will 
undergo this study this afternoon.  I have also sent off a repeat CBC 
with differential, a repeat urinalysis and amylase and lipase levels to 
rule out pancreatitis.  Of note, patient does have a history of peptic 
ulcer disease, however, he was guaiac negative in the Emergency Room and 
reports no episodes of hematemesis, hematochezia, or melena.  He is also 
status post cholecystectomy.  I will review his IVP later today and make 
further therapeutic interventions at that time.

Pullman, MN 74618



Dear Thomas:



  Thank you very much for referring Mr.  Weeks for evaluation of coronary disease, mitral insufficiency, atrial fibrillation, and congestive heart failure.  As you know, he is a 78-year-old gentleman who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting on 07/20/2096 and had two-vessel CABG at that time with a LIMA to mid LAD and a saphenous vein graft to the right coronary artery.  Left atrial appendage was amputated and he had a closure of a PFO as well as a CryoMAZE procedure.  The patient had symptoms of dyspnea on exertion prior to coronary artery bypass grafting.  After the coronary artery bypass grafting, he had done well but now is noting that the shortness of breath and dyspnea on exertion has recurred.  It has been progressive over the last several months.  He had been seen by GI and also by Pulmonary and has been treated for gastroesophageal reflux.  He was found to have a pleural effusion which has been drained and he has had sclerosing of that.  He has also had an admission for renal failure this spring.



Past medical history:

   Notable for insulin-dependent diabetes.  

Hypertension.  

Hypercholesterolemia.  

Hyperhomocysteinemia.  

Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.  

Benign prostatic hypertrophy.  

Gout.  

Renal insufficiency.  

Mild thrombocytopenia.



Current Medications:

  atenolol 25 mg BID

 Coumadin; Dir: as directed

 Ecotrin 325 mg qd

 Lipitor 20 mg qd

 Lasix 120 mg qd

 folate 1 mg qd

 allopurinol 100 mg qd

 Ativan

 Proscar

 free text medications; Dir: Insulin

 Protonix



Allergies:

No known drug allergy   or IV contrast dye.



Family history:

   Positive for brother who is status post stent placement at the age of 78 and another brother with congestive heart failure.  There is also peripheral vascular disease and diabetes in his family.



Social history:

   The patient has a 25-pack-year history of smoking, quit in 2065.  He does not drink alcohol.  He lives independently with his wife and comes to the interview with his daughter who works at Casco Bay Shipping.



Review of systems:

   Negative for fevers, chills, weight loss or gain.  He has not had any visual loss or hearing loss.  He denies hematochezia.  He has not had difficulty swallowing, change in bowel habits, constipation, diarrhea, or hematemesis.  He denies chest pain, PND, orthopnea, or pedal edema.  He denies dysuria or hematuria.  He has not had any rashes or poor healing wound lesions.



Physical examination:

-Pulse:   55 and regular

-BP: 160/80    in the right and left arm in seated position

-resp. rate:   12 and unlabored

-Heent:   No xanthelasma, scleral icterus, proptosis, or lid lag.  Mucous membranes are moist.  Trachea is midline

-Neck:   Thyroid is not palpable.  Carotids are 2+ without bruits.  Have a normal upstroke.  JVP is less than 7 cm of water

-Chest:   Clear without rales, rhonchi, or wheezes.  He does have low dullness in both bases

-Cardiac:   Remarkable for well-healed midline incision of the sternum.  He has a normal S1 and S2 and a grade 1/6 holosystolic murmur radiating to the apex and a grade 1/6 high-pitched holosystolic murmur at the left sternal border which is different from the other murmur

-Abdomen:   Normal bowel sounds.  No organomegaly.  No pulsatile masses

-Extremities:   Peripheral pulses are 2+ and symmetric.  He has no pedal edema.  He has no clubbing or cyanosis



Procedures:

Tc MIBI STATUS POST The patient underwent adenosine MIBI testing on.  His heart rate from 67 to 90 which was only 62% of the maximal predicted heart rate.  Peak blood pressure was 158/80.  He had no chest pain.  Nuclear imaging showed distal anterior wall and apical septal defect consistent with mild-to-moderate ischemia in that distribution.  The patient has also had an event monitor but we do not have the results of that in hand.



EKG:

    today shows atrial fibrillation with a fairly regular rate at about 55, leftward axis, and IVCD with nonspecific ST-T wave abnormalities.



Selected recent labs:

 Laboratory results recently have shown plasma creatinine of 2.4, BUN of 42, hematocrit of 30.4, white count of 5.4, and platelet count of 92,000 all done on 12/22/2096 and 12/26/2096.



Assessment and plan:

   In summary, this is a 78-year-old gentleman who has a history of coronary artery bypass grafting, closure of PFO, and ligation of the left atrial appendage and Maze procedure which was done in July 2096. His anginal equivalent prior to that was dyspnea on exertion and he did well for a period of time but now has dyspnea on exertion again. There are a number of factors involved here. He has atrial fibrillation which is now recurrent but the rate seems to be reasonably well controlled. I doubt that, that is playing a role in his shortness of breath. He also has a history of plural effusions which could have been contributing to shortness of breath as well and that has been dealt with corrosion of the pleura. He has mitral regurgitation which in the past was said to be moderate and he has had the closure of PFO. He has insulin-dependent diabetes and hypertension. He also has low platelets. The recurrence of the exertional dyspnea is certainly worrisome for recurrence of coronary disease particularly with the exercise test showing anterior wall ischemia. It may be that there are other issues contributing to this, the atrial fibrillation and mitral regurgitation. He has murmur consistent with mitral regurgitation, but he has no evidence of decompensated congestive failure at this time. Blood pressure is elevated somewhat and I think that increase in his Avapro might be worthwhile. He also has chronic renal insufficiency which makes things more complicated as well. My feeling is that we are dealing with recurrence of coronary disease and I spoke with the patient about this. He is clearly limited in his exercise capacity and wants to have something done. I would like to get an echocardiogram to be sure we are dealing with constrictive disease, but I think he will probably need to have a cardiac catheterization. I would like to get the echocardiogram, bring him in for cardiac catheterization, and see if there are narrowings either in the graft or in his native arteries that may be contributing to the anterior wall ischemia. Starting him on an antiarrhythmic to see if we can reestablish sinus rhythm may be worth considering or perhaps cardioversion after the cardiac catheterization. Because of renal insufficiency, cardiac catheterization is a little bit more complicated and that the low platelets are also an issue we need to address.

Past History:  T & A, laparoscopic cholecystectomy.  He has no other major illnesses.  He does not smoke and drinks about one glass of wine per day.



Family History: His father died at 83 of a stroke, cancer and diabetes.  Mother died at 73 of heart disease, diabetes and cancer.  Two sisters are living without diabetes.



Social History:  He a mapping technologist and is actively working.  He is divorced and has two children and one grandchild.  His significant other works as an optician.  She is divorced and has three children and one grandchild.



Complete Cardiovascular Exam:. BP 100 50/65.  His jugular venous pressure is seven and he has no carotid bruits.  He has no rales.  He has a 1/6 aortic ejection murmur, a 2/6 MR murmur at the apex with a normal S2 and no S3.  He has no enlargement of the liver and no edema.



EKG:   NSR 59, LAE, NSTTWA



Assessment: I agree he clearly needs a coronary angiogram as well as a left ventricular angiogram to assess MR.  He should also have a left right heart catheter because of the aortic ejection murmur.  In the meantime I will ask into double his isosorbide to 40 mg in the morning and again at 3 p.m. to give him better protection throughout the day.  I will ask him to increase his aspirin to 325 mg a day.  I will also add fish oil 1000 mg a day which is been shown to reduce the risk of sudden death.  Finally we will double his Zocor to 40 mg to try to reach the new goal of an LDL of less than 70.  I explained the rationale for proceeding on with the catheterization and the probability that we will find multivessel disease that will not be suitable for PCI but rather for continued medicine or possible surgery.  Of course the catheterization will determine that.  He should not consider any total knee operation until the cardiac status is clarified.

Time of note: 1630 hours

Patient seen and examined with the team.  Note of Dr. Ellis reviewed, findings confirmed.  Available electronic notes reviewed, X-rays reviewed, labs reviewed.  

73 y. o. woman who has worked as a nurse at TLC for 40 years.  Nonsmoker.  History of hypertension treated with Hyzaar.  Current illness began 5-6 months ago with fatigue, dyspnea on exertion that has progressed to the point that she has to stop to catch her breath after walking up only 4-5 steps in a stairwell.  She finds it difficult to get started on her work because of fatigue.  She has had a cough that initially produced yellowish, ""slimy"" sputum, but more recently has been dry.  She notes occasional wheezing.  She also noted muscle and joint pain involving the shoulders and lower extremities over the past 5-6 months that she attributed to ""arthritis"".  No polyuria, but has noted nocturia X2 for the past 5-6 months. During the same period of time, has noted very dry mouth. No abdominal pain, but some difficulty with constipation for the past two weeks.

Appetite diminished and she lost about 30 pounds.  She noted a nodule on the extensor surface of the left elbow that her PCP ""cut into"" recently.  She has also noted a nodule on the dorsal surface of the right foot that seems to ""get larger"".  

She experienced substernal chest pain with radiation to the back that lasted several hours, prompting her to come to the ER.  No associated diaphoresis, nausea.  Pain somewhat better with sitting up.  

Of note, she has known of having a cardiac murmur for many years.  

Exam:  Pleasant black woman in no distress.  BP 158/79, Pulse 80, regular; O2 sat 98% on room air.  Afebrile.  Skin darkly pigmented nodule left elbow extensor surface, similar nodule right dorsal foot just proximal to 4th/5th toe.  No other rashes.  HEENT:  pale conjunctivae, anicteric.  No nasal findings, no facial skin findings (specifically, no lupus pernio).  Dry mucous membranes.  Neck: small, soft, mobile 0.5 cm node left anterior cervical chain.  Chest:  inspiratory crackles at both bases.  Cardiac: No JVD.  Regular rhythm.  III/VI (I do not feel a thrill) harsh nearly holosystolic murmur heard throughout the precordium, but especially prominent at the RUSB with radiation to the clavicles, neck.  Also heard at the apex and radiates to the left mid-back (?same murmur).  The murmur intensifies when she stands.  No gallops.  No rub.  Abdomen soft and nontender.  No spleen tip.  Liver edge not palpable.  
Lymph nodes:  fullness below the left axilla, although not confident of discrete nodes.  

Data:  There is considerable testing available to us from her recent visits to the Walk-In Clinic and to Dr. Utter.  

A CXR from 5/2097 shows bilateral hilar adenopathy, mediastinal adenopathy, and interstitial infiltrates.

Serum angiotensin converting enzyme 68 (7-46 U/L)
LDH 354

EKG:  ST elevations V1-3.

Problems:

1.  Dyspnea on exertion, progressive.
2.  Interstitial lung disease.
3.  Bilateral hilar adenopathy
4.  Weight loss
5.  Symptomatic hypercalcemia
		Nocturia
		Arthralgias
		Constipation
		Fatigue
6.  Prominent systolic murmur(s?). Changes with maneuvers suggest this may be secondary to hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy.  There was evidence to suggest this on an echo from 2085, but obviously, need more recent data.
7.  Minimally elevated troponins.  Uncertain significance.
8.  Anemia, mildly microcytic.
9.  Elevated LDH.
10.  Renal insufficiency, likely secondary to uncontrolled hypercalcemia.
11.  History of hypertension.

Discussion:

Sarcoidosis, until proven otherwise.  She is obviously older than typical presentation of sarcoidosis, but she had previous lymphadenopathy that may have been a first presentation of the illness with spontaneous remission.  The lung findings, systemic symptoms, hypercalcemia, anemia, abnormal serum ACE level are all suggestive of this diagnosis.  

Her hypercalcemia is symptomatic and should be treated with volume repletion.  She should not receive diuretics at present.  Long term treatment will be dependent on the underlying diagnosis and its treatment.  I think she will need corticosteroids for her sarcoidosis and I expect this will improve the hypercalcemia, but we need definitive diagnosis first.  

The cardiac murmur is impressive, but likely unrelated to the pulmonary disease.  We need echocardiogram to better define valvular function.  The minimally elevated troponins are not felt to be of clinical significance at this point.  Appreciate Cardiology input on this finding.  

Suggest:

1.  Stop HCTZ,avoid diuretics until fully volume repleted.
2.  IV normal saline.  May need rates in the 150-200 range to control her hypercalcemia acutely, but she has had this for some time, so can be conservative with fluids approach.
3.  Agree with check PTH, vitamin D levels.
4.  Follow lytes, creatinine, calcium, Hct.
5.  Agree with check echocardiogram.
6.  We should ask the Pulmonary Service to see her in consultation.  Bronchoscopy with biopsy may be the best way to obtain confirmatory tissue for diagnosis of sarcoidosis.

Dear Dr. Jean:




 

Your patient Henry Oswaldo was seen today by myself at the Atmore Community Hospital today following coronary artery bypass on August 15, 2096 .  He has had a relatively unremarkable recovery with out complication.  Today,  Mr. Oswaldo  looks and feels well, and complains of no issues.    On examination, the lungs are clear, cardiac rate and rhythm are normal. The  incision is healing very nicely.   


Chest radiograph reveals normal findings.  EKG shows no acute changes and is basically normal.  His rate is mildly elevated today despite being on a beta blocker. 


Patient education was completed with respect to:  medication review, weight restriction/lifting/activities, cardiac rehabilitation.


Overall, I am quite pleased with progress.   He has increased activity and should plan to enroll in cardiac rehabilitation in a few weeks.  He  seems to be making an excellent recovery from surgery.  


Thank you for the privilege of participating in the care of this very nice gentleman.  I am confident the surgery will afford  significant and lasting benefit and relief from symptoms of angina .  I would consider increasing his Toprol dose, but will leave this to your discretion if his rate remains elevated in follow-up. I am releasing  him to your care.  We would be happy to see him at any time in the future, if you should so desire.  



With warm regards,  


Sincerely yours,

History of Present Illness

Asked by Dr. Trujillo to comment on diabetes management for this patient. Hx from chart as pt is dutch speaking only. 



Mrs. Trent is a pleasant 69 y/o woman with type 2 DM insulin treated. She has acknowledged difficulty following her regimen, per notes should be taking insulin BID but only takes it in am - prescribed dose NPH 30 in am and 8 at HS. Reports BG at home near 150. 



She is s/p L SFA and doing well from that standopoint, however developed N&V today and required NG tube placement, now better but remaoins NPO. 



She has been on NPH 30 in am and BG's have been 126- low 200's.

Glycemic control in the post operative period is essential to good wound healing and minimizing risk of infections. Our target is to maintain BG under 150.



Recommendation

- While NPO please use 1/2 day time NPH but her usual prescribed bed time dose - for now 15 nph in am and 8 at hs

- Once eating can resume usual doses, may need addition of rapid action insulin with meals as well



Thank you, please page Internal Medicine # 42721 with any questions.

Plastic Surgery     Consult Note
Patient:  Richard, Ulysses
MRN#:  8913196
Date of Consult:  7/26/78

Chief Complaint:  Open surgical wound right leg

HPI:  85 yo WM w/ multiple medical problems presents s/p right common femoral to anterior tibial bypass with failure of his right lower leg surgical wound to close.  He has peripheral vascular disease with a prior left femoral-tibial bypass graft.  He initially presented to the vascular surgery clinic with an ischemic ulceration in the right foot. There were no lesions amenable to percutaneous intervention and he underwent right common femoral artery to distal anterior tibial artery in situ saphenous vein bypass graft on 6/01/78. He was discharged to an acute rehabilitation facility on 6/07 where he reports initially doing well. The patient was readmitted in early June because of fevers.  No source of the fevers were determined but he was started on an empiric regimen of antibiotics.  During that admission, every other staple in his wound was removed.  The patient came back to clinic where all of his sutures were removed.  The surgical site over the lower leg never completely healed and the open area was treated with daily dressing changes.  He was seen in clinic for follow-up today where his wound was again noted to be open in proximity to the graft.  Plastic surgery is consulted regarding closure options.

Physical Examination:  
General: Alert, oriented, NAD, good historian
Lower extremities:  Multiple well-healed incisions.  On the right lower extremity, there is an incision from the groin to the foot.  It is well-healed with the exception of a 5 x 2 cm area over the lower third of the leg just medial to the tibia.  The graft is palpable just lateral to the area.  The base of the wound appears to have granulation tissue.  No odor.  There is minimal erythema and tenderness around the site.  Distal pulses palpable. Foot warm and well-perfused but with no sensation below the ankle.  There are other venous stasis ulcers in various stages of healing.  The great toe has an ulcer with overlying eschar.

Relevant Laboratory Values:
Pending

Assessment: 85 yo WM w/ multiple medical comorbidities presents with need for wound coverage of a right saphenous vein bypass graft.  This may be amenable to local flap coverage.

Recommendations: 
-Tentative plan wound debridement/possible flap closure this week

Reason for visit

	

  88 year old man h/o type 2 DM, CAD here for follow up



History of present illness

	

  He missed his last appointment, but today he states that he has been feeling fine. He reports no chest pain, no dyspnea, no palpitations, no orthopnea, no PND. He is ambulating around the house without a problem. He has some occasional leg pains, but he now takes acetaminophen instead of nitroglycerin. He reports no recent ankle swelling, because he states that he elevates his legs. 



He cares for his wife- doing chores around the house, such as washing dishes or making the bed. The only thing he reports being unable to do is lifting arms over his head (old problem).



Major Problems





Coronary artery disease

s/p anterior MI 2082, LAD PTCA 2082. Cath 90% RCA, occluded OM2 2082. Echo 2087 EF =67%, no WMA (previously had apical dyskinesis). R/I'd for NSTEMI (TnT 1.35) in setting of 4 U GI Bleed (11/92), complicated by CHF. Last LDL 59 on lovastatin.



Osteoarthritis

Severe DJD of bilat shoulder -limited abduction 80 degrees. No significant symptoms. Seen by Dr. Etheridge in past.



Diabetes mellitus

Dx 7/88, on low dose glucophage with excellent control- d/c'd 10/91 when HbA1C all wnl. Urine alb slightly high at 71 (8/94). HbA1C up to 8.0%- started on glyburide. Last check 6.7%



Active Medications



aspirin 81mg po qd

atenolol 100mg po qd

furosemide 20 mg po 2-3 tabs daily

glyburide 1.25mg po qd take with breakfast or first meal

lisinopril 2.5 mg po qd

lovastatin 20mg po qpm take with food

multivitamins 

nitroglycerin 0.3mg AS DIRECTED



Social history

	

  Married, 4 daughters from previous marriage. 3 sons each killed in separate MVA. Former smoker quit 20 years ago, (+) EtOH. 11 grandchildren, 9 GGC



Procedures and Immunizations 

Influenza vaccine 

 Received 11/95 MLL



Review of systems

	

  As above, no abdominal pain, no urinary complaints. No complaints of constipation or rectal pain. No BRBPR. Nocturia x 1-2. Rest negative in detail.



Physical Exam

Blood pressure 124/70  

Pulse 68  irregular

Selected recent labs

	

  EKG- AF at 68, new RBBB, LAH. 

CMP/CBC/HbA1C

Urine for albumin



Assessment and plan

	

  1. AF: recurrence of his AF, but no significant CHF and no symptoms to suggest active ischemia. He is already rate controlled on beta blocker. Decision to anti-coagulate is not easy. On one hand, he is a very functional man. On the other hand, he is 88, walks with a cane for balance, and is not very fond of frequent doctors visits. Discussed EKG findings and anticoagulation with Dr. Youmans, his cardiologist. Dr. Youmans will see patient next week. 

2. CAD/CHF: Stable- Continue ASA/BB/ACEI/statin. BP OK. 

3. DM: HbA1C normal on low dose glyburide. (+) microalb- on ACEI- check again today. 

4. PUD: no recent bleeding. No symptoms. 

5. HCM: Flushot 11/95. Declines c-scope (last 2087).

PATIENT NAME:  MEYER, OSCAR;    MRN:  2771447

Dictated on:  02/06/2095 by VICTOR M. ZUBIA, M.D.





Oncology CONSULTATION NOTE:



DATE OF CONSULTATION:



DIAGNOSIS:  T2b, NX, M0 Gleason 4+3=7 adenocarcinoma of the prostate.



HISTORY:  Mr. Meyar is a delightful patient referred to me by Dr. Osiel Mckee.  His PSA in 2093 was 3.8, early this year 6.3, and on repeat 7.1.  Abnormality was noted on digital rectal exam.  He has very little in the way of voiding symptoms with a good stream, no dribbling, nor any frequency.  He does still have his erections, though they are not as good as they used to be.  The erections are still an important issue with him.  Dr. Mckee performed a transrectal ultrasound that showed a 13 cc prostate.  He took 12 biopsy cores and all 12 demonstrated prostate cancer.  In 4 it was Gleason 6 and in the remainder Gleason 7.  Many cores had a predominant Gleason 4 pattern.  Many of the cores were heavily involved with 40% involvement or more.  Mr. Mercado has a CT scan and a pelvic MRI scheduled for next week.



PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:

1.	Diabetes.

2.	Nephrolithiasis status post lithotripsy.

3.	Tonsillectomy.

4.	Right inguinal hernia repair.

5.	Inflammatory bowel disease.



CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Glipizide, metformin, and Avandia.



DRUG ALLERGIES:  None known.



SOCIAL HISTORY:  His father was diagnosed with prostate cancer in his late 70s, but he did not die from his disease.



SOCIAL HISTORY:  He works as a Web Developer in Audiovox.  He is married and came with his wife to the appointment today.  He has no children.  He is a former smoker and occasional drinker.





PHYSICAL EXAM:

No anemia, jaundice, cyanosis, or clubbing

No gynecomastia

Respiration comfortable

No neurologic abnormalities in the arms or legs

No skeletal deformity or tenderness

Head, eyes, ears, and nose normal 

Abdomen soft with no hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, nor any additional masses.

No hernias.

Normal penis, scrotum, and testes.

Rectum: no mural lesion. Stool guaiac negative

Prostate is small.  The entire right side of his gland is taken up with tumor.



IMPRESSION AND PLAN:  Mr. Meyer is a young man with a significant and quite bulky prostate cancer.  I certainly do not think active surveillance is an option for him, which is a shame, as that was his preference.  Left untreated, I think he will be in deep trouble at some stage over the next few years.  His second choice for treatment is prostate brachytherapy but again I believe his disease is too extensive for this and brachytherapy would represent significant under treatment.



On balance, my preference for him is either to have a radical prostatectomy, perhaps followed by postoperative radiation or alternatively, if he wishes to avoid surgery and he does, for him to have high-dose external radiation in conjunction with neoadjuvant and concomitant androgen deprivation.  While I think he will recover good voiding function after either of these treatment combinations his sex life is under threat and he is aware of this.  We will defer the final decision next week until he has had his scans.  Obviously, should they show extensive extracapsular disease then surgery will be off the table, if they show nodal disease the same is true and we will be thinking in terms of long-term androgen deprivation.  Hopefully neither of these scenarios will occur.

Studies:	

CT I -: NO SIGNIFICANT INTERVAL CHANGE FROM THE PRIOR STUDY.  NO ACUTE INTRACRANIAL FINDINGS.



CXR: Cardiomegaly with interstitial pulmonary edema.  The findings

	are more prominent then the prior study from 4/27/73 x-ray.

              

EKG:  NSR 72 with TWF in I and TWI in L unchanged from 9/18



Impression: 

55 yo male with multiple medical problems presents from rehab facility with recurrence of shaking activity. His current exam is c/w encephalopathy with no focal neurological deficits. The patient has multiple reasons to be encephalopathic including renal insufficiency, opiate withdrawal or hypertensive encephalopathy. He does not appear to be having seizures because his movements are not rhythmic and are altered during interactions with examiners.

 

Recommendations: 

-   check UA, NH3

-   lower systolic blood pressure to below 200, e.g. with Labetalol.

-   Give 2g MgSO4 (given renal insuff), follow Mg bid and dose Mg bid to keep level at high end of normal.

-  Check EEG to assess for epileptiform activity

-  Check MRI/A to assess for posterior leukoencephalopathy



This case was discussed with the ED neurology senior resident Dr Benjamin Iles 



Thank you for this interesting consult.

He says it started Saturday with a tickle in his throat; he went to the race track on Sunday and felt the same; on Tuesday he had dry cough, occasionally bringing up clear sputum.  He had no fevers but perhaps some mild sweats.  He notes mild sinus congestion and post-nasal drip.  No known sick contacts.  He got a flu shot at the TFMC in 11/74 and pneumovax at last appt in 11/74.  He is feeling mostly better, and was able to work out on the treadmill for 1.5 miles without difficulty.

Follow Up - post hospitalization visit



He was admitted 2/01-2/03/74 for NSTEMI.  On 1/31 he had symptoms similar to those he experienced prior to his MI in 2073: pain in back of left neck, left shoulder, and left arm.  As a result he did not exercise that day.  The symptoms improved spontaneously.  On 2/01 he did his normal exercise routine, running on the treadmill for 40 minutes; he felt fine.  Later that day, he had recurrence of the symptoms so he called Dr. Ishmael's answering service.  Dr. Patterson was covering and recommended he go to ED.  He is very impressed that Dr. Patterson saw him that evening in the ED.  There EKG showed no changes but troponin-I and CK screen were positive.  He was admitted to cardiology service and managed with integrullin and heparin.  When second set of enzymes was positive on 2/02 he went to cath lab, where old RCA stent was ""pristine,"" LAD showed stable 50% lesion, but distal LCx showed 90% lesion.  He had PTCA and stenting with medicated stent, producing excellent result.  He was discharged on 2/03 on plavix.



Today, he says he has had no recurrence of symptoms.  He is feeling great.  He is concerned that he had the MI despite taking all his medications as prescribed and feeling so well with exercise.  He wonders whether he needs to re-start cardiac rehab.  He is avoiding exercise until he sees Dr. Ishmael next week.  He has had no groin hematoma or other complications.

UHRICH,KARSON   456-30-26-8                 VISIT DATE: 06/29/82
The patient was seen and evaluated with the medical intern, I agree 
with the medical intern's note. 
PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  The patient is a 65-year-old female with a 
history of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, depression, H 
pylori, gastric reflux with increasing back pain and epigastric 
pain. 
HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  She says over the last couple of 
days it is unrelieved with food but not exacerbated by food.  She 
occasionally has a pressure in her epigastrium, no radiation to her 
neck, chest, no shortness of breath, no palpitations, no 
diaphoresis, no vomiting, no hematochezia, or melena but she has 
had increased frequency of her BM to three or four a day.  No 
dysuria or urgency.  She describes the pain as constant. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, GERD. 
MEDICATIONS:  Tetracycline, Prilosec, Ativan, atenolol, Zestril. 
ALLERGIES:  Aspirin which causes upset stomach. 
SOCIAL HISTORY AND FAMILY HISTORY:  Nonsmoker. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 98.1, pulse 92, respiratory rate 
16, blood pressure 196/84.  Skin:  Warm and dry.  She is 
well-developed, well-nourished female in no distress.  Pupils are 
equal, round, reactive light.  Extraocular movements are full. 
Sinuses nontender.  Oropharynx clear.  Nasopharynx clear.  Neck: 
Supple, full range of motion.  There is no JVD.  Heart:  Regular 
rate and rhythm without murmur.  Abdomen is soft.  Lungs are clear. 
Extremities:  There is no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.  Rectal 
exam is nontender with brown, trace guaiac positive stool. 
Neurologic exam is nonfocal.

THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  Patient was seen, given aspirin, 
Lopressor, and nitroglycerin.  If her pain doesn't resolve with and 
a GI cocktail she will be admitted to the Observation Unit.  Because 
 of the concern that her pain goes to her back, she has a CT scan 
to rule out aortic dissection which is reviewed with the 
Radiologist and is negative. 
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  Atypical chest pain, perhaps consistent with 
angina. 
DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  Condition at 
this time is stable.

EDVISIT^62115644^Lara, Uriah^03/21/92^MELENDEZ, LEAH

Resident's history, physical examination, and evaluation reviewed

by me and I concur.  In addition, I personally interviewed and

examined this patient.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 59-year-old male with

history of elevated cholesterol who presents for evaluation of

intermittent neck pain and arm discomfort over the course of the

last several weeks and now with substernal chest pain radiating

to the neck since 6 hours prior to admission.  The patient does

not have any documented history of CAD.  He has noted over the

last several weeks episodes of exertional right-sided neck aching

and arm discomfort with arm numbness, which seems to occur with

exertion and resolve with rest.  He has no noted over the last

week, but on exertion, he has had episodes of bilateral neck

aching discomfort with radiating achy into both of the arms.  His

symptoms generally resolve with rest.  Today, approximately 6

hours prior to presentation, he was driving when he had the onset

of bilateral neck and arm aching pain with substernal chest

discomfort, shortness of breath, a sensation of palpitations and

mild sweatiness.  He had no nausea and no vomiting.  His symptoms

persisted over the course of last several hours, and he presented

to the Emergency Department for evaluation.  He denies any prior

history of chest pain in the past.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Positive only for elevated cholesterol and

questionable history of PE in the past.  He did smoke in the past

and drinks occasionally.  He lives with his significant other.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Reviewed and is positive for early CAD in his

father.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Other systems are reviewed and otherwise

negative except per the HPI.

MEDICATIONS:  Only Lipitor.

ALLERGIES:  No medical allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature is 95.2, pulse 96,

respirations 18, blood pressure 121/65, and the O2 saturation is

94%.  The patient is awake, alert, middle age male who appears

mildly uncomfortable but in no respiratory distress, reclining on

the stretcher.  Head examination is normocephalic, atraumatic. 

His pupils are equal and reactive to light.  His sclerae are

anicteric.  His conjunctivae are pink and moist.  He has moist

mucous membranes with no erythema.  His neck is supple and

nontender.  The trachea is midline.  There is no adenopathy. 

There is no JVD.  He has full range of motion.  There is no

subcutaneous emphysema.  His lungs reveal mild tachypnea.  There

is no chest wall tenderness.  There is no accessory muscle use. 

He has bibasilar crackles in both lower lung fields.  There is no

wheezing and equal breath sounds.  His cardiac examination is

tachycardic and regular at about 100 with a 4/6 systolic murmur

heard prominently at the apex as well as at the right second

intercostal space.  There is no rub.  His pulses are normal.  His

abdomen is minimally obese but nondistended, soft, nontender, no

guarding, no peritoneal signs.  There is no organomegaly and no

pulsatile masses.  His skin is intact, warm, somewhat moist but

not diaphoretic.  There are no rashes.  Extremities reveal no

cyanosis, clubbing, or edema.  Calves are soft and nontender with

no palpable cords, full range of motion with normal strength and

tone.  He is oriented x3.  Cranial nerves are intact.  There is

no motor or sensory deficit.

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  The patient had IV access

initiated.  He was placed on a cardiac monitor.  EKG was

performed.  He received 1 time sublingual nitroglycerin with a

drop in his blood pressure to systolic in the high 70s.  A second

IV was placed.  Right-sided EKG leads were performed, and the

patient received IV fluid bolus.  He had already received

aspirin.  His white blood cell count is 8.4, hematocrit 41, and

platelets 175,000.  His electrolytes are within normal limits. 

His BUN is 18, creatinine 0.9, and glucose 124.  His CK was 93. 

His troponin was less than assay.  His initial EKG showed normal

sinus rhythm in the 80s with a normal axis, normal intervals. 

His pseudonormalization noted only in lead III.  He has

approximately 1.5 mm ST depression with normal ST segments in the

anteroseptal leads with somewhat hyperacute appearing T waves. 

Right-sided leads show some mild, less than 1-mm, ST upward

sloping in V2 through V5.  He had a chest x-ray performed that

showed a normal mediastinum and some mild fluffy alveolar

infiltrates in the bases but no obvious consolidation and no

significant cephalization.  He had blood pressures checked in

both arms once his blood pressure improved after an IV fluid

bolus and was noted to have a persistent 20 point difference in

systolic blood pressures of 136/65 on the right and 111/65 on the

left.  When the patient was questioned about this, he states that

he has had that noted in his doctor's office in the past.  He

underwent CT scanning of the chest, which ruled out aortic

dissection after discussion with the attending radiologist.  As

his blood pressure stabilized, he received IV Lopressor and

became pain free.  He did not require any further nitroglycerin. 

Repeat EKG was performed showing resolution of the 0.5 mm ST

depression in the anterior leads.  Given the patient's cardiac

risk factor and his history, which is fairly worrisome for

 ******** Not reviewed by Attending Physician ********

with a diagnosis of chest pain, rule out new-onset angina.  He

does remain pain free now and has maintained a stable blood

pressure after IV fluid bolus.  See the note for full details.

Critical care time was 45 minutes.

KEKELA INPATIENT DIALYSIS ADMIT NOTE





NAME: Marsh, Carl

MRN: 99579205



Primary Care MD: Xavier T. Mccoy



Outpatient Nephrologist: Keith Tierney

Outpatient Dialysis Unit:  Sanford Memorial Hospital, S and T

Estimated dry weight: 61 kg

Dialysis access: left AVF



Reason for admission:    body jerking    since last night



HPI: 



74 year old Turkmenistan male with a past medical history of ESRD presumably secondary to HTN presents to the KEKELA ED with complaints of    body jerking    since last night.  The patient was in his otherwise good state of health when he went to his normal dialysis session yesterday.  The session was uneventful, and he finished dialysis around 7:30 pm.  Around 9 pm, he started noting un-controlable jerky movements of his jaw, arms, and legs.  He was unable to stand by himself, and had difficulty with any motor activity.  It was so bad that he was unable to feed himself, and needed help from his wife to do so.  The jerking continued throughout the night without getting better, and his daughter called his PCP's office today, at which time he was instructed to proceed to the KEKELA ED.  He has had a similar episode like this before in January of 2092, when he developed the exact same jerking movements after a long three day weekend when he went without dialysis (see note in LMR by neurology consultant).  It was deemed at that time that his myoclonus was due to    electrolyte disarray,    and he was admitted to EDUCARE-FARGO and received dialysis the same day with complete resolution of symptoms.  He has been symptom-free since that time.



He reports no other new events.  He denies any new medications.



Past Medical History: 



1.)	ESRD secondary to hypertension

ASSESSMENT:



74 year old male who presents with:



1.)	Myoclonus   unclear etiology without obvious precipitants; the last time this happened, it was in the setting of not getting dialyzed after three days.  While he did get dialysis yesterday per his normal schedule, it is odd that his potassium today is 5.5, suggesting perhaps either dietary indiscretion (which he denies) or, perhaps, inadequate dialysis.  In addition, he says that his dialysis center has been taking him off    early    a few times in the past week, though he notes that he got a full run yesterday (3    hours)

2.)	chronic HD

3.)	h/o MGUS   shoulder fat pads



PLAN:



1.)	Admit to Renal Medicine service, Dr. Tierney attending

2.)	Will plan on dialysis tomorrow for two reasons: (1) high potassium, (2) see if this helps with myoclonus

3.)	Will contact dialysis center tomorrow to see if any problems with his runs, and what his most recent URR or Kt/V was

4.)	continue Phos-Lo 2001 tid with meals

5.)	Kayexalate 30 po tonight for elevated potassium



Discussed with Dr. Tierney

Name:  Richard, Ulysses
Medical Record: 8913196
Attending:  Snyder

History of Present Illness:  Mr Ulysses is an 85 yom with h/p PVD s/p multiple bilateral lower extremity revascularizations and a non-healing wound on the RLE.  Most recently, he had undergone Rle necrotic ulcer debridement (07/78),R CFA to distal anterior tibial BPG on 05/78.  The wound was overlying the BPG.  He was made NWB on R, with VAC dressing applied to the wound to be changed twice weekly.  He has been followed in clinic.  Though he was noted to have good granulation tissue during his hospitalization one month ago, recently his wound has been concerning for non-healing.  In clinic, his RLE is ischemic, and there is a concern for wound infection.
The patient reports that the proximal aspect of his wound had pregressive breakdown over the past 2-3 weeks, with associated increase in pain, especially with VAC changes.  He says that he could no longer feel a palpable graft pulse as he could just after the surgery.  His foot became increasingly discolored, and his toe became necrotic after some minor trauma without response to silvadene.
No fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. Trent is 69, a pleasant lady who is now a widow well known to me for her insulin-dependent diabetes and her poor compliance with treatment.  In the past, she also has experienced upper GI bleeding due to a peptic ulcer and has undergone cholecystectomy as well as lobectomy for carcinoma of the lung.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Humulin N 25 units in the morning.  She is supposed to be using 28 units in the morning and 8 units in the evening depending on blood sugars.  She also has been prescribed an ACE inhibitor and a beta blocker, which she has neglected to take.  Her last visit to the practice was in September of last year.

At the time of her last visit, I referred to vascular surgery because of claudication of the right leg.  She underwent a femoral public TL bypass in December and did well postoperatively.  She was discharged on simvastatin, Plavix, as well as atenolol and lisinopril.  She abandoned all tablets on her own and did not come for her followup appointment with us.  Today, she tells me that claudication in the right leg has disappeared completely but during the past two months, she has begun noticing pain in the left leg after 10-15 minutes of walking which forces her to stop.  An arteriogram carried out in September of last year showed mild diffuse disease involving the left common iliac, external iliac, and common femoral arteries.  She did not have symptoms on the left side at the time.

The patient denies chest pain, palpitation, shortness of breath, orthopnea, and ankle edema.  Prior to her bypass surgery on the right leg, she underwent a Persantine MIBI which showed only 1 mm ST depressions and was considered not diagnostic.

Ms. Trent has experienced some polyuria and mild polydipsia and has two times nocturia.  She denies dysuria.  The last hemoglobin A1c was 8.4 in September of last year.  At that time, her serum cholesterol was 238, HDL was 59, and triglycerides were 263.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Today, she is pleasant and talkative.  Her weight is 127-1/2 pounds, blood pressure 180/76, and heart rate is 96.  Oxygen saturation 100% on room air.  Random fingerstick glucose is 202.  Extraocular movements are full.  The thyroid is not enlarged.  The neck veins are flat.  The chest is clear to auscultation.  The breasts are free of masses.  There is no axillary lymphadenopathy.  The heart sounds are regular.  There are no rubs or gallops.  There is a midline abdominal scar which corresponds to an old operation for peptic ulcer.  There is also a right upper quadrant cholecystectomy scar which is surrounded by a mass, which has been present in the past that probably represents fibrosis under the scar.  No other masses are palpable.  The lower extremities are free of edema.  I do not palpate the pulse except in the dorsalis pedis area of the right side, but there are no trophic changes and the skin is warm and pink.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  A 69-year-old widow lady with moderately controlled insulin-dependent diabetes and hyperlipidemia.  She has not been compliant with her medications.  She has suffered from peripheral vascular disease and claudication in the past underwent a bypass surgery on the right lower extremity in October of last year.  She now has mild symptoms of claudication on the left.  She continues to consume three or four beers a day.  The relationship to her vascular atherosclerosis is not clear.  Liver function in the past has been normal and she does not have significant proteinuria.  Today, I have repeated her hemoglobin A1c, comprehensive panel, CBC, and urine analysis.  I have spent 20 minutes speaking to her and to her daughter concerning the importance of compliance and explaining the rationale for the lisinopril.  I have prescribed Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q.d., lisinopril 10 mg p.o. q.d., and enteric-coated aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d. She is also to take a multivitamin q.d.  I will see her again after the above test results to decide whether we need to adjust her medications.  I have increased her insulin to 28 units every morning.  She will come to see the nurse practitioner in three days' time to learn how to use a glucometer and to review diabetes care.  An electrocardiogram will be obtained and a consultation will be arranged with vascular surgery concerning the claudication now on the left leg.

Nevada Hospital

Dear Gray:




 

I had the pleasure of seeing your patient Mr. Henry Oswaldo in clinic today. As you know, he is a 78-year-old gentleman with diabetes who was hospitalized at 06/28/2096 in Quito with any acute coronary syndrome with anterior myocardial infarction.  I am seeing him on your request to evaluate him for possible coronary artery bypass surgery.  I have reviewed his records and I have summarized the findings.   



The patient denies having had symptoms of angina until his recent visit to Quiti.  At that time in June he had several days of very sharp chest tightness and diaphoresis that were prolonged.  He then presented to the Merlin Clinic in Quuto. He was found to have an anterior myocardial infarction and underwent catheterization there that showed a critical stenosis of the LAD ( sequential lesions 95 and 99%), first OM(90%) and his right ( dominant vessel with an 80% proximal and then 90%  distal). An LV gram showed an EF of 55% with just mild mitral regurgitation.  An echo performed here at the Wyandot was consistent. 



Since he has returned to America several weeks ago, he has only had one episode of his chest discomfort, which occurred when he was getting rushed to come to the clinic. Since then, he has had no further episodes. 


ROS: Denies PND, orthopnea, symptoms of TIA, stroke, lightheaded, or syncope. He does get some pain in his right leg with exertion.


PMH: Diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia,  stroke (numbness in his right hand and leg, but that had predominantly resolved).


Meds: aspirin 81 mg a day, clopidogrel 75 mg a day, bisoprolol 5 mg once a day, ranitidine 300 mg a day, atorvastatin 40 mg a day, metformin 1000 mg b.i.d., and Imdur 20 mg in the morning and 10 in the evening. This is an Equadorian formulation.


SHx:
He does not drink, nor smoke.


FHx:  Cancer of the prostate and a mother who died of cancer at 60. Brother who is diabetic and the other who had cancer of the prostate.



On exam, he looks well. His heart rate is in the 64. His blood pressure was 115/70. His carotids were 2+ with normal upstrokes and no bruits. His jugular venous pressures were not elevated. His chest was clear to auscultation. His cardiac exam revealed a  2/6 holosystolic murmur at the apex. His abdomen was soft. Extremities were warm and well perfused with good femoral and distal pulses. Neurological exam is grossly normal without focal deficit.





In summary, Mr. Oswaldo is a very nice Spanish speaking 78-year-old gentleman with diabetes and a significant 3-vessel disease. He is likely best suited for CABG and I spent a significant amount of time explaining why stenting his situation would be less satisfactory.  I will obtain a screening duplex ultrasound of his carotids to assess this risk prior to proceeding.



With warm regards,  


Sincerely yours,

Internal Medicine B Intern Admission Note

PATIENT: GOLDY WILHELM
MRN: 9543443
ADMIT DATE: June 29, 2097
ATTENDING: Dr. William Xian
PCP: Dr. Casey Frey (new)
CONTACT: Leo Wilhelm, son  705-690-8475
CODE: Full

Source: Patient, family, chart
ID/CC: no appetite, acute renal failure

HPI: 73 yo black woman with h/o HTN and recurrent non-malignant axillary lymphadenopathy, newly diagnosed with HOCM in the setting of fatigue, weight loss and hypercalcemia concerning for sarcoidosis during a work-up at her last admission to MEDIQUIK on 6/2-6/20/97. At that time, the patient noted that 3-4 mo PTA she had experienced worsening fatigue and dry mouth, as well as poor oral intake with associated 30 lb weight loss. 

In early May, she presented to the walk-in clinic with these complaints and a CXR showed increased interstitial markings and mediastinal lymphadenopathy subsequently confirmed by CT. A PET CT showed FDG avidity in multiple enlarged thoracic and axillary nodes. The patient was seen at the lymphoma center by Dr. Utter, and concern was raised for multiple processes including sarcoid, lupus-like syndromes, Castleman's, and indolent lymphoma. Labs drawn at different times in recent past were notable for a Ca of 11.8 with Alb of 3.5, a mild tranaminitis in the 40s, LDH of 354, ACE of 68, normal TSH, HCT of 30.2, ESR of 85, SPEP with diffuse gamma globulin increase, positive ANA at 1:2560 with nuclear pore staining (highly specific for biliary cirrhosis), elevated B2MG at 17.5, and elevated kappa and lambda free light chains at 66 and 83.5, respectively and negative HIV. The patient   s hypercalcemia was treated with IVF, lasix at times, and a dose of bisphosphonate, which led to a decrease in Ca to 10.1.

Axillary lymph node biopsy 6/08/97 revealed non-specific follicular hyperplasia, though to be consistent with a reactive process. Oncology was consulted, and a lymphoma work-up was pursued; flow cytometry revealed polyclonal CD19+ B cells, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, with no evidence for a monoclonal B or unusual T cell population. Repeat CT examination of the chest revealed no change in the bilateral axillary, mediastinal, and hilar lymphadenopathy and offered no further clues to diagnostic possibilities.  The patient underwent pulmonary function testing, which showed a reduction in the FEV1, FVC, and FEV1/FVC ratio; total lung capacity and subdivisions were normal, resistance and specific conductance were normal, and single breath diffusion capacity was reduced. On 7/19/97, a bronchoscopy was attempted, but the patient was unable to tolerate the procedure, and it was not performed. Thoracic surgery was consulted and recommended that the patient be evaluated in the outpatient setting for biopsy under general anesthesia. Fungal antibodies were sent, and a trial of steroids was not attempted during hospitalization. 
 
Since discharge, the pt reports that she continues to feel very fatigued, and has not    felt like eating.    She reports significant acid reflux, saying    only water goes down    and a lack of appetite with very dry mouth. She notes continued weight loss of 15lbs since leaving the hospital, tolerating little more than 1-2 cans of Ensure/day per her family. She further denies N/V, diarrhea, fever/chills/dizziness or recent infection. Of note, she has been drinking little, but urinating 9-10 times a day, clear urine with large volumes. She has not had a bowel movement for several days. She has continued her medications as instructed at the time of discharge.

In addition, her family notes a dramatic change in her mood and activity level since prior to hospitalization. She used to be very active, working nearly every day and keeping up her household. She now spends most of her day in bed sleeping, relying on her children for help and awakening early in the AM unintentionally. She has felt too tired to pursue her usual nightly bingo game. She denies suicidal ideation, saying she has her four grandchildren to liver for.
   
ED COURSE: At the ED, the patient was afebrile, HR 59, BP 136/61, RR 16, O2 Sat 95%. She was given IVF and labs were drawn.

ECG: NSR @ 82bpm, LVH unchanged from prior study


Impression: 
73F h/o newly dx HOCM, chronic systemic LAD, fatigue, and weight loss concerning for sarcoid vs. PBC vs. neoplasm, presenting with acute renal failure in setting of little PO intake and likely hypercalcemia. Hypercalcemia (as in vitamin D excess secondary to sarcoid) can cause polyuria via osmotic diuresis, with dehydration, anorexia, constipation, and PUD, fatigue and depression. This would thus represent a unifying diagnosis for this pt   s anorexia and acute renal failure, which is most likely prerenal.

Plan: 
ARF: - f/u Ca + Phos. Expect Ca to be high, Phos to be low. Cont IVF
   - Cre 2.2   1.8 (bl 1.2-15) s/p IVF 500cc x1, on D5    NS @ 100cc/hr, re-evaluate and re-bolus in AM
          - Maintain good UO, no Foley b/c recording stricts I   s + O   s, 700cc out of clear urine O/N
Fatigue/Weight Loss/LAD/lack of appetite: 
-prior labs somewhat concerning for PBC, esp with elev AlkP
-f/u anti-mitochondrial Ab, TSH, f/u pending labs from prior w/u
-consider re-attempting transbronchial biopsy, revisit w/ thoracics 
Anemia: -Hct stable, slightly microcytic. MVI

  MR#4692758
  January 10, 2114
  
  Return visit.  Reason for visit: 73 year old male for evaluation/management multiple
  issues.  
  
  Diabetes: he is on maximal dose of glipizide and Glucophage and A1C has been going up
  steadily now to 8.0.  His sugars vary greatly in the morning from 100 to 174.  He hasn't
  been checking pre dinner.  We discussed insulin and he really is quite against it.  We will
  continue discussion open.  Asked him to check pre dinner sugars.  
  
  Coronary disease: patient had a mild posterior ischemia in 2112 on a screening stress test. 
  He is actually having some progressive dyspnea on exertion and a sense of chest
  tightness with one block.  He is a bit of a denier.  He hasn't tried nitroglycerin, which I
  have given him.  I suggested he do that.  He will have a follow up stress test and we will
  arrange a cardiology consult.  
  
  UTI: patient had an E coli UTI 9/13.  He doesn't really have much in terms of other
  prostate symptoms and no nocturia.  He has however, developed urinary urgency again in
  the last week or two.  Will check another culture.  May need urology referral.  
  
  Knee pain: patient with longstanding DJD of the knees.  Will have a consult at Christiana Hospital considering replacement.  
  
  Family history: unchanged.   
  
  Review of systems: status post an embolic stroke in 2111 and took warfarin for 2 years
  and followed by Dr. Dillon.  He is still on Celexa for depression.  He is having hearing
  loss with equivocal audiograms.  Suggested otology consult at Naples Community Hospital.  He has
  a mild hypoproliferative anemia that is stable.  Sleep apnea.  All other systems negative. 
  
  Physical exam: his weight is 196 pounds.  Most recent 195.  BP was 140/70.  Pulse 60. 
  Skin normal.  Nodes: none.  Chest clear lungs.  Cardiac: S1, S2 normal.  Grade II/VI
  systolic murmur of mitral regurgitation (confirmed by echo).  Abdomen no mass or
  organomegaly.  Extremities: mild venous stasis.  Trace edema.  DP pulses are 1+.
  
  Assessment: management of multiple medical problems as above.  Lab work up to date.  
  
  Disposition: every 4 months.  Comprehensive 5/14.

Walk-in clinic                                Xian, Imogene

                                              81376761

                                              5-31-71

 

 

HPI: Ms. Xian is a 74-year-old female who presented to clinic this 

evening for follow up of her diabetes. Patient was last seen in clinic in 

11-70 after which time she left for Ghana for the past six months. She 

returned this past Friday but has since run out of insulin. She states 

that she has been feeling well and has not had any problems but does not 

know the amount of insulin that she has been taking. It has been 

administered to her by a friend in Ghana. Our records show that when 

she left Ghana she was on a 70/30 of Humulin, 20 units per day and 

also 600mg of Rezulin and 20mg q.d. of Lipitor.

 

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Review of systems is positive for insulin dependent 

diabetes mellitus but other than that Ms. Xian is a fairly healthy woman. 

 

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On physical exam this evening her pulse is 80. Blood 

pressure was 152/80 in her left arm. Blood sugar was 262. It should be 

noted that she has not had any insulin since Sunday. Her weight was 116 1/2 

which reflects a 1/2 lb. weight loss since 11-70. Tonight her heart had a 

regular rate and rhythm at 80. Her neck veins were flat. Her lungs were 

clear to auscultation bilaterally and there was no evidence of peripheral 

edema. 

 

ASSESSMENT: Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus. 

 

PLAN: LFTs, A1C, basic panel this evening. Glucotrol 10mg dispense No. 60 

with 1 refill b.i.d. A VNA referral for medication management and patient 

was instructed to return to the clinic on Saturday 6-05 for repeat blood 

sugar and also to bring her glucometer at that time so that it could be 

calibrated correctly.

EKG:   septal Q wave. NSR.



CXR: no pulmonary edema.  



Head CT: 1.  There is a region of low attenuation in the left occipital

lobe which may represent a subacute infarct.  MRI of the brain with DWI would be helpful for further characterization. 2.  Right maxillary sinus and nondisplaced right orbital floor fractures, as described above. 3.  Mild atrophy and nonspecific white-matter change likely

related to microangiopathic-small vessel ischemic change. 4.  Old left thalamic infarct.





A/P:  57 yoM w/ MMP presenting with syncope and facial fracture. Appears to have recurrent syncope of unclear etiology.  Cardiac etiology would be of greatest concern given hx of CAD and chest pain, though certainly cerebrovascular disease is present given CVA history.



Plan:

1. Neuro: hx of CVA on ASA

-MRI/MRA to r/o vertebrobasilar disease

2. PULM: CPAP at night for OSA

3. COR: ROMI, interrogate pacer, holter monitor, ASA, ACE, BB, Zocor

4.ENDO: RISS

5.RENAL: gentle IVF for elevated creatinine likely pre-renal etiology

6.DISPO: SS consult. Obtain MR to see what w/u has been done for patient at SHH for syncope.

Dear Wanda:

Mr. Vance returns for followup.  Since last seen, she apparently was recently seen in the walk-in clinic in your office complaining of profound fatigue and depression.  She wonders if she was having a flare of her porphyria.  Apparently, her examination at that time was relatively benign, and no specific new findings were noted.  After talking with Dr. Vogt at that office visit, she felt modestly improved, and over the past few weeks feels that her energy level has returned to its baseline.  Lab studies obtained at that time revealed creatinine 0.9, glucose elevated at 236, hematocrit of 43, with a white count 10.  As no specific pathology was noted, she was sent home without any change in her medical regimen.

Currently, she continues on Lantus insulin 20 units subcutaneous. q.p.m., Celexa 40 mg p.o. q.d., enteric-coated aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d., Flonase 1-2 puffs p.o. q.d., isosorbide mononitrate 60 mg p.o. q.d., Neurontin 600 mg p.o. t.i.d., nitroglycerin p.r.n. which she has not had to take, lisinopril 10 mg p.o. q.d., furosemide 20 mg p.o. q.d., and p.r.n. Motrin.

Physical exam reveals a thin woman in no acute distress.  Blood pressure right arm sitting 105/78, heart rate 70 and regular, respirations 14 and unlabored, and weight is pending.  The neck is supple.  JVP is flat.  Carotids are 2+ with very soft bilateral referred murmurs.  Chest is clear.  Cardiac exam shows normal S1, physiologically split S2 with 1/6 systolic ejection murmur radiating from the apex to the base, and a 1-2/6 holosystolic murmur radiating from the apex to the axilla.  No significant diastolic murmur or rub.  The abdomen is benign.  Extremities reveal trace bipedal edema.  Peripheral pulses are diminished but detectable.

Electrocardiogram is pending.

Impression:  Ms. Vance remains relatively stable from a cardiovascular perspective.  However, as you know, her last echocardiogram did show evidence of at least moderate mitral regurgitation with significantly reduced left ventricular systolic function.  She has made it quite clear that under no circumstances would she consider repeat cardiac surgery to treat her valvular heart disease.  Nonetheless, I think it would be helpful for her to undergo repeat echocardiogram to help gauge the current status of her left ventricle and degree of regurgitation, which may allow for additional modifications to her therapeutic regimen.  Beyond this, her condition is actually relatively stable from a cardiovascular standpoint.  I have not further altered her medical regimen.

Thank you very much for allowing me to assist in her care.

Sincerely yours,

EDVISIT^03689964^VALENZUELA, BRIAN^10/15/92^BENSON, KAILEE

I saw this patient in conjunction with Dr. Otis. I confirm

that I have interviewed and examined the patient, reviewed the

resident's documentation on the patient's chart, and discussed

the evaluation, plan of care, and disposition with the patient.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  A 55-year-old male with vomiting.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient with end-stage multiple

sclerosis as well as neurogenic bladder and chronic indwelling

Foley who presents from the nursing home after 4 episodes of

vomiting since 10:00 a.m.  He has had also progressive abdominal

distention, he reports over the last 3-4 weeks.  Nursing note

also reports decreased urine output for the last 2 days.  He had

a KUB done at the referring facility that demonstrated a question

of a small bowel obstruction but this film was not sent with him.

 He also had a fever today per report.  The patient denies any

abdominal pain, shortness of breath, chest pain, or other

complaints.  He does have a history of an ileus and prior

admissions for urosepsis with levofloxacin resistant E. coli.  He

reports a mild cough.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Remarkable for hypertension, multiple

sclerosis, anemia, decubitus ulcers, neurogenic bladder, and

urethral strictures.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  He is status post urethral stenting.

Social history, family history, and review of systems are as per

written note.

MEDICATIONS:  Prozac, Actonel, ferrous sulfate, aspirin,

multivitamins, lisinopril, Lipitor, and Prilosec.

ALLERGIES:  None.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient is awake and alert, generally

chronically ill appearing, quite pleasant.  Vital signs are

within normal limits as documented except for an elevated pulse

rate of 120 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 24, room air

saturations of 93% and a temperature of 99.2.  For full physical

exam findings, please see the resident's written note. 

Specifically, HEENT exam is atraumatic.  There is a 1-cm ulcer on

roof of his mouth.  He has synechiae of his pupils that are 2 mm

and nonreactive.  His extraocular movements are not alignment. 

Neck exam is normal as documented.  Respiratory exam reveals

scattered bronchi.  There is no chest wall tenderness. 

Cardiovascular exam reveals tachycardia without murmur. 

Abdominal exam is distinctly distended and slightly firm with

hypoactive bowel sounds but no tenderness, no rebound or

guarding.  Skin is intact, warm, and dry on my exam. 

Musculoskeletal exam is nontender with no edema or bony point

tenderness.  Neurologically, the patient has increased tone in

his lower extremities and weakness of all of his extremities. 

His mood and affect is normal but he is dysarthric.  He is

neurologically, however, appears to be at his baseline.

LABORATORY DATA:  CBC and electrolytes remarkable for white blood

count 16.2, BUN and creatinine ratio of 40 and 1.0 respectively. 

Last creatinine was 0.5.  LFTs and lipase are within normal

limits as documented.  INR is 1.1.

IMAGING STUDIES:  EKG demonstrates sinus rhythm with nonspecific

ST-T wave changes.  Plain films of the abdomen demonstrates

scattered dilated loops of small bowel but no clear obstruction

consistent with possible ileus versus early obstruction.  Chest

x-ray shows low lung volumes without any focal consolidation.

IMPRESSION:  This is a patient with abdominal distention, is

quite impressive as well as a firm belly with dilated loops of

bowel on his KUB as well as history of vomiting earlier this

evening.  He has had no vomiting here and does not feel

nauseated, however, does not have an appetite.  He has had

decreased urine output and managed to put out a total 25 cc of

urine through his Foley since 2:00 p.m. today.  Presently, he was

not tender over his bladder.  Upon flushing the Foley, there is a

large amount of debris.  They came out and followed by high

pressure urine that had malodorous character to it.  I think this

patient likely has an ileus and urinary tract infection.  He

received antibiotics wide spectrum including vancomycin,

levofloxacin and Flagyl initially followed by gentamicin given

his prior levofloxacin resistance.

PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS:  Urinary tract infection.

SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS:  Ileus versus SBO.

The patient was admitted to the ED Observation Area for CT

imaging, however will eventually require admission for this

problem likely to Medicine Service.

DISPOSITION:  Admitted to ED Observation Unit.

RADIATION ONCOLOGY FOLLOW-UP NOTE


HEATH, QUINTEN M. 805-94-75


REFERRING PHYSICIAN: Fred Quebedeaux, M.D.


DATE OF VISIT: 2/4/2173


REASON FOR VISIT: Reassessment of progress, s/p postoperative adjuvant radiation therapy in combination with concurrent chemotherapy for esophageal adenocarcinoma, T2N1 stage IIB, s/p left thoracoabdominal esophagectomy (12/01/69) with pathologic tumor stage T2N1M0 (3/23 involved lymph nodes).


POSTOPERATIVE RADIATION THERAPY:  For the presence of metastatic disease in regional lymph nodes, he was judged a candidate for postoperative adjuvant chemo-radiation therapy.  He was treated with a total dose of 45 Gy in 25 fractions to the tumor bed region using IMRT, planned with 4D CT simulation.  This treatment was administered in combination with chemotherapy between March 29, 2170, and Apr 30, 2170.  


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Quinten Heath is a 77 year-old gentleman with a history of smoking, chronic GERD, HTN, CAD s/p PCI, partially blocked L carotid artery and AAA repair x 2.  He was in his USOH until 8/69 when he began to have difficulty swallowing.  While eating a hamburger he felt it lodge in his chest with accompanying retrosternal discomfort and increased salivation.  He has had about a dozen similar episodes since then, which have generally resolved within 10-15 minutes without regurgitation.  In 9/69 his PCP prescribed a PPI, which helped somewhat, but he continued to have dysphagia.  On 10/16/69 EGD at Griffin Hospital demonstrated a partially-obstructing distal esophageal mass 34-39 cm from the incisors, associated with Barrett&#8217;s esophagus, with pathology significant for well differentiated invasive adenocarcinoma.  On 10/17/69 CT of the chest and abdomen showed prominent thickening of the distal esophagus.  On 10/21/69 repeat CT of the chest showed an 8 mm LLL nodule and R-sided pleural thickening.  Upper EUS showed a partially obstructing esophageal mass extending from 35-40 cm with 9 mm thickness, suggestive of invasion to the muscularis propria, one suspicious mediastinal LN, and porta hepatis adenopathy.  On 10/22 FNA of a porta hepatis LN was negative.


He underwent a left thoracoabdominal esophagectomy on 12/1/69. Pathology showed an ulcerated tumor measuring 4.0x3.5x0.8 cm, invading into muscularis propria (pT2) and metastasis to 3 of 27 LN (N1).  


INTERVAL HISTORY/REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: 
He has been doing well without significant GI or respiratory symptoms.
He has maintained steady energy and appetite.
He has had mild dysphagia for solid and meat. Otherwise, he has been doing well.
He denies significant respiratory symptoms. No focal or generalized neurological symptoms. The remainder of review of systems was unremarkable.

Dear Bethany: 


I saw your patient, Fay Foust, in my office today.  Mrs. Foust is a 65-year-old woman who is feeling significantly improved, but who complains of dizziness after she takes her medications.  Her history of severe hypertension, without definite secondary causes, only a mild left renal artery stenosis, a recent admission for chest discomfort and hypertension, with a CTA that disclosed only modest plaques in her 3 major coronary arteries, treated dyslipidemia, type II diabetes, and vigorous left ventricular systolic function and significant left ventricular hypertrophy, is detailed above.  


Ms. Foust feels that her life has been brought back to her.  She takes her amlodipine, lisinopril, and carvedilol at 8:30 a.m.  Thirty minutes later, she states that she feels lightheaded and her blood pressure can be in the 100/70 mmHg range to 120/80 mmHg range.  She believes that her heart rate is approximately 60 beats per minute at those times.  After 1-2 hours, she starts to feel improved.  At 8:30 p.m., when she takes only her carvedilol and amlodipine, again, she has similar symptoms.  When she has the symptoms, she sometimes also notices a discomfort in her low back.  She has not had dyspnea and she has only rare episodes of mild chest heaviness.  She has not had palpitations.  She has not had actual lower extremity swelling, though she feels that after her metformin, her legs can feel heavy.  She is not having an alteration in gastrointestinal or genitourinary habits. She has not had musculoskeletal achiness, aside from the low back discomfort described.  She has not had any peripheral numbness.  The rest of the review of systems is unremarkable.  


The present medications are ASA 81 mg a.m., lisinopril 40 mg a.m., amlodipine one-half of a 10 mg tablet a.m., carvedilol 25 mg a.m. and 25 mg evening, simvastatin 40 mg before bedtime, and metformin 500 mg before dinner. 


On examination, the weight is 110 pounds, decreased 3 pounds compared to 01/96.  The blood pressure was initially 136/60 mmHg with a heart rate of 60 beats per minute, respiratory rate 12, and she was complaining of low back discomfort, and she was very slightly lightheaded.  Later, the blood pressure was 160/70 mmHg and she stated that her blood pressure has not been so high for the last several weeks.  She was still complaining of slightly dizziness and low back discomfort.  The skin is warm and dry and she looks quite calm.  She is fully alert.  The neck veins are not elevated.  The carotid upstrokes are brisk and the volumes are normal.  There are no carotid bruits though there was a transmitted murmur.  The lungs are clear.  The PMI is not displaced.  There is a normal-sounding S1 and a physiologically split S2, with a soft, 2/6 early-peaking systolic murmur across the aortic valve that decreases with Valsalva.  The abdomen is benign. There is no renal artery bruit.  The distal pulses remain excellent and there is no pedal edema.  There is no tenderness of her skin.  The resting electrocardiogram shows a sinus bradycardia at a rate of 56 beats per minute, intervals of 0.20/0.08/0.40, 45-degree axis, very slight inferolateral ST segment flattening. 


Impression:  Mrs. Foust is feeling much-improved.  The dizziness and low back discomfort that she describes could possibly be associated with a drop in blood pressure to 170 mmHg, with mild hypoperfusion of her spinal arteries, as well as her head.  However, today she had dizziness even with a blood pressure of 160 mmHg.  Though we could be tempted to juggle with her regimen and reduce her amlodipine slightly, or change the times when she takes the medications, I think that we are facing some difficulties only related to the poor autoregulation of her cerebral and peripheral vessels.  I think that we should continue her on her present regimen.  Gradually, we would expect her symptoms, related to changes in blood pressure, to improve as her vessel elasticity improves.  I think that we can be satisfied that she is not becoming too bradycardic.  We are pleased with the present regimen.  We have never been absolutely certain that there has been no tiny penetrating aortic ulcer for her discomforts or so dramatic, but the treatment would be precisely as it is now.  We were not surprised by her CTA and her treatment, naturally, remains unchanged.  I think that we want her to continue her metformin, and we may have to consider increasing it to at least twice daily, depending on followup A1c values.  


Thank you for allowing me to assist in Mrs. Foust's care.  I know that you will continue to follow her closely.  I told her that I would see her again in nine months.  


Sincerely,

71F w/ multiple medical problems, including dCHF, restrictive lung disease, severe polyarthritis returns to clinic doing significantly better for the most part.

Regarding her shortness of breath, she undewent a stress test which was completely wnl. She has also lost some weight (intentional) and states that, although she still gets short of breath with exertion, it is noticeably better.  She is being followed by the pulmonary department and is under consideration for a cardiopulmonary exercise test.

For her cough, the nexium has helped a lot and she likely has sig reflux despite the negative esophagram. The weight loss is probably helping with the gerd as well.

Regarding her arthritis, he L shoulder pain is much improved with PT.  Her biggest complaint at the moment, though, is her low back pain. She was seen in pain clinic for two injections. She states that the injections may have helped for 1-2 days but then the pain returned. She says this is her most limiting symptom. She is begging for narcotics.

Lastly, she has clear stress urinary incontinence, was cleared for a TOT sling but has now decided to push this procedure off until next spring.

A/P: 71F w/ MMPs including CAD w/ recent normal MIBI, diastolic CHF, restrictive lung disease, osteoarthritis returns to clinic doing somewhat better than before.

1)CV: Pt has diastolic CHF, w/ vol status cont to be improved on exam w/ almost no le edema on lasix (minimal hjr). She still c/o doe but even this is much improved. Etiology is likely multifactorial (restrictive lung, diastolic chf, obesity/OSA/deconditioning). Recent echo w/ EF 65% and DD. Recent MIBI wnl--no ischemia. BP well controlled and HR 60s. Cont to eat salt.  
-cont diovan 160, hctz 25, lasix 20, carvedilol, plavix (per family doc), lipitor.
-Close monitoring of electrolytes. Re-check today.

-Check lytes, LFTs today.
-F/U with cardiology in clinic

2)Pulm: Shortness of breath likely multifactorial.  Recent PFTs reveal presence of restrictive lung disease with impaired diffusion. However, effort was sub-optimal and patient volume overloaded.  Also w/ significant obesity. Pt had recent sleep study confirming OSA. CT chest w/ non-specific findings and an ""indeterminate"" nodule.
-Am not opposed to cardiopulmonary testing per pulmonary, though sxs are slowly improving.
-Pt would like to discuss w/ pulm re: CPAP for her OSA. Will hold off setting up cpap titration until then.

Diabetes.  The patient is trying to adhere to his diet.  He stays on his usual medicines, which include Glucophage and glyburide.  He takes an aspirin regularly and he is on his blood pressure medicines.  He does not smoke.  He follows closely his foot regimen and had not noticed any difficulty.  He sees a foot doctor.  He has not seen an eye doctor recently.  He has not been to the Jay Hospital for his routine followup and says he will start setting up appointments with the diabetes group out in Littleton, Wisconsin where he lives.  The patient specifically denies any increased thirst or urination.  His blood sugars taken at home are approximately 140-160 on a fasting basis.  He has not had any episodes of hypoglycemia.


Coronary artery disease.  The patient is also followed by Dr. Garza.  He does stay on his Plavix and aspirin and also is on other medicines including atenolol, hydrochlorothiazide, Norvasc, Vasotec and he has not needed any nitroglycerin.  He still does complain of some nonspecific chest type discomfort for which he was evaluated by Dr. Garza last spring.  He had a cardiac catheterization.


Elevated cholesterol.  The patient does take the Lipitor.  He does not have any muscle aches.


Slightly elevated liver function tests.  He had a history of fatty liver.


Obstructive sleep apnea.  The patient refuses to take CPAP.


REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Reveals no headaches, no difficulty with the ears, nose or throat.  No neck pain, no chronic cough or sputum production and no chest pains or palpitations.  No nausea, vomiting, black or bloody stools.  No burning on urination.  His weight has been fairly stable.


PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Showed a pleasant white male in no acute distress.  Blood pressure taken by me 132/76, pulse 72 and weight 206 pounds.  Skin was moist and warm without any specific lesions.  Head, ears, eyes, nose and throat were normal.  Neck showed no thyroid nodes or tenderness.  No bruits were heard.  Lungs were clear to percussion and auscultation.  Heart showed a regular sinus rhythm.  S1, S2 were normal.  Abdomen was soft, no liver or spleen was felt.  Chest wall without any pain secondary to his prior coronary artery bypass graft surgery.  Extremities showed pulses to be satisfactory.  His feet were warm.  There was no sign of infection.  Neurologic, well oriented.  Light touch was found easily in his feet.


IMPRESSION:  Overall, the patient is satisfied with his health.  He has followup appointment with the cardiologist and needs to follow up with the eye doctor as well.  He will set up a diabetes follow up at the Rappahannock Medical Clinic.


DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Diabetes mellitus, on oral hypoglycemic medicines, will recheck his hemoglobin A1c, recheck his urine and urine for protein.


The patient does take his enalapril regularly as well.


2.Coronary artery disease on multiple medicines without any severe angina.  He is followed by Dr. Garza.  His weight has been fairly stable.  He has not needed to use his nitroglycerin.


3.Obstructive sleep apnea.  The patient refuses to take the therapy.


Elevated cholesterol, on Lipitor.


Essential hypertension on medicine.


Left kidney mass.  Dr. Jefferson did not feel this was any real finding.


Follow up will be in four to six months in my office for a comprehensive exam.

Re:	Jarome DEJESUS

Dear Dr. Ponce:



I had the pleasure of caring for Mr. Dejesus during his ECI admission 05/16-07/14.  He is a 72-year-old man with CAD S/P diagnostic cath one week ago at SCMHC, found to have a moderately tight lesion in the LAD without significant disease in the left circumflex or RCA.  Because of the recent onset of angina and a stress test showing anterior ischemia, he was brought to ECI, where Dr. Yoseph Flint stented the LAD lesion with a 3.5mm by 32mm Taxus drug-eluting stent, with zero percent residual.  The right femoral arteriotomy was closed with an Angioseal, and there were no complications.  



He spent an uneventful evening without complaints, ambulating without difficulty.  His left groin was soft without hematoma or bruit, and extremities were warm and well perfused.  Morning labs included a BUN of 17, creatinine 0.9, hematocrit 37, platelets 236,000, and flat cardiac enzymes.  He was discharged home on Plavix, 75mg po qd for a minimum of six months; enteric-coated aspirin, 325mg po qd; digoxin, 0.25mg po qd; glyburide, 5mg po bid; metoprolol, 50mg po bid; Lipitor, 20mg po qd; Tikosyn, 500mcg po bid; Glucophage, to be resumed at 500mg po bid in two days; and Coumadin, to be resumed tonight.  He has PT/INR check arranged in several days.  He will follow up with you in the next two weeks, and will see his PMD, Dr. Paige, in the near future.  Thank you for allowing us to participate in his care.  Please call if you have questions.



Sincerely,

Re: Hannah Heath

OCH #: 91156456





Dear Dr. Norwood,

 

I had the pleasure of seeing your patient, Hannah Heath, for consultation in the Vascular dept at the OCH.  As you know she is a 72 year-old woman with prior stroke. I will review his medical history for our records.



HPI: This is a 72-year-old right-handed woman with a history of hypertension, diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia and PAF with a prior stroke (2067) who subsequently was admitted to the OCH again for SDH with supratherapeutic INR in 2068. She has a prolonged hospital course as well as rehab stay and now returns having made significant recovery.  She is here with her family who is translating.  She ambulates with walker, but does well over short distances without it.  She communicates well with eth family and is able to feed and dress herself.  She has an aid for bathing three ties per week. She has not needed the PEG tube in the past 6 months and is eager to have it removed. She has not had any new episodes of weakness, numbness, visual or language changes.



ROS: 

Denies fevers, chills, chest pain, SOB, palpitations, leg cramps, claudication, DOE, cough, wheezing, hemoptysis, heartburn, abdominal pain, hematemesis, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, melena, dysuria, changes in bowl or bladder habits, rashes, arthralgia or myalgias, polyuria, polydipsia, bruising or bleeding problems.  Review of neurological system as above.



PMH: 

Hypertension 

Diabetes

Elevated cholesterol.

Stroke 

SDH



MEDS:

Lipitor 10mg qd

Protonix 40mg qd

Diltiazem 60mg qd

Metoprolol 50mg qd



ALL: 

NKDA



SHX: 

Married and lives with her husband. She has a very supportive family. 



FHX: 

Sister with seizures.



PHYSICAL EXAM:

BP: 120/60 		HR:70		RR: 14

GEN: Pleasant woman in NAD.

HEENT. AT/NC.  Sclera anicteric.  OP is clear.  There is no thyromegaly. 

NECK: Supple. No LAD.  Carotids are 2+ without bruits. 

HEART: RRR, no m/r/g

LUNGS: CTA

ABD: +BS. Soft.  PEG site inspected.  Slightly red margin. No significant drainage at this time. No odor.

EXT: No c/c/e

SKIN: No rashes or ulcers. 

NEURO: Cognitive testing limited secondary to language barrier. Alert and oriented.  Interacting well in Spanish with  her family members. No neglect or apraxias. Pupils  3->2mm.  Fundi are normal. EOMI without nystagmus. Right field cut.  Right facial. Tongue and palate are midline. Facial sensation is intact. Hearing is normal.  On motor exam there is normal muscle bulk, but increased tone right more than left. She has a mild right HP. There is a RPD. On sensory exam, pp/temp/vib are symmetric.  There is distal gradient loss of sensation.  There is no loss of cortical sensation.  There is mild ataxia with FNF and HTS and RAM on the right. Gait is normal based and uses a walker. Reflexes are symmetric. Plantar responses are extensor.



DATA:

MRI 2068: old right MCA stroke

CT 2068: SDH



ASSESSMENT/ RECOMMENDATIONS:

72 year-old woman with vascular risk factors including atrial fibrillation and prior stroke  with a subsequent SDH with super elevated INR who now returns for follow-up.  She has had a significant recovery. Our goal should now be secondary stroke prevention and risk factor modification.  Given that her bleed was a SDH and in the setting of elevated INR, it is worth considering restarting warfarin,  until then, she should at least be on ASA and I have communicated this with them. She should continue with her BP and cholesterol treatment as well. She is eager to remove the PEG and I will refer her to Dr Queen for this. RTC as needed. Call with questions.







More than 50% of this visit was spent on patient education and counseling.

Thank you for allowing me to participate in the care of your patient.  I will continue to follow along with you.

History of Present Illness:  Pt is a 59 yo Khazakhstani male, with h/o HTN, DM, mucormycosis, and ESRD on HD presenting with a thrombosed AVF in his left arm, established in April of 2064 by Dr. Jordon.  The patient has a history of multiple problems with access (clots, stenoses), requiring frequent thrombectomies and revisions.   The patient first noticed a problem on July 23, and by the 24th he said that ""the access had collapsed."" On July 25, interventional radiology attempted to thrombectomize the clot, with no success, requiring placement of a new tunneled catheter in left IJ to allow dialysis.  At present, patient is on the OR waiting list for tomorrow, for thrombectomy/revision.  



Of note, patient was admitted in April of 2064 after a nurse at the McLaren Hospital detected a new cardiac murmur.  Pt was found to have a RA thrombus by echo, presumed to be a complication from a prior catheter, started on a heparin gtt and transitioned to coumadin.

Betty has been doing ""okay"" since our last visit; she continues to report a slow decline in swallowing ability.  She had a video swallow at SJMH; she and Fitzpatrick were told that the underlying problem was local changes due to her radiation.  Her gait has been unchanged, but she still feels it has deteriorated a little over the last year.



She is gardening, and trying to stay active; she has had no falls and uses a cane.



She recently added amlodipine for her hypertension.





Echocardiogram:

Date: 9/02/95: borderline LVH, preserved EF.  Posterobasal HK.  Not done for PFO.



Brain & Vessel Studies:

MRI/A:

CTA:

3/20/98: ""severe proximal LICA stenosis"", just distal to bifurcation...no comment on comparison.

9/29/95:  >90% RCCA, unchanged from the exam of 9/04/95.  >90% LCCA proximal to the stent with elevated flow velocities within the stent.  70-75% LICA.  The estimation of stenosis in the left internal carotid artery may be low because of tandem stenoses in the left carotid artery.  Compared to the study of 9/04/95, the LICA lesion is modestly worse. >50% in B ECAs.

9/26/95: Lbif stenosis >= 50%.  Rbif without significant stenosis.  RVA dominant.

  	  	  	  	  	  	Ultrasound:

8/24/95: Low RCCA 50-75%, Mid LCCA 75-90%, calcified LICA possibly >50%

  	  	  	  	  	  	Angiography:

8/27/95: proximal RCCA stenosis >80%, ACA cross-filling from L-->R.  Right vertebral irregular/stenotic.  LCCA, bifurcation, LICA with significant tandem stenoses; at the proximal mid-LCCA, >80%.

  	  	

Functional Cerebrovascular Studies:

Diamox SPECT 7/14/97: interpreted as normal.

  	  	

Vascular Procedures:

Right CEA (years ago)

8/31/95: (1) right vertebral origin balloon angioplasty, successful.  (2) LCCA stent followed by balloon angioplasty.  (3) although wanted to stent LICA, exceeded fluoro time.

Blood pressure in the left arm is 174/60.

She appears well overall, but slightly anxious.  Cognitively, she appears unchanged; her speech is fluent, with intact repetition and comprehension, and her recall of recent events (corroborated by her daughter) is good.



Pupils are equal and reactive, EOMI, VFFTC.  Face, tongue and palate are symmetric, but she is dysarthric; glottal sounds worst.  This sounds slightly worse than our previous visit.  Strength is full in all extremities; her mild dysmetria is unchanged.  Her walk, always wide-based and slightly unsteady, appears mildly worse than our previous visit, but she is not using a cane, and is able to catch herself after mild stumbles.  She is unable to tandem gait.



Impression:

Betty is a 78 year old woman with progressive cerebrovascular disease due to local radiation, plus diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia.  She is s/p left ICA stents and right VA angioplasty.  Her most significant vascular lesion is stenosis proximal to the ICA stent, but there is no hint now of transient or orthostatic symptoms.



My continued feeling is that we ought to focus on her controllable risk factors, such as diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, as you are doing.  I understand you have recently been adjusting her antihypertensive regimen.  I would recommend a goal systolic blood pressure no lower than 120 mmHg.



I think a reasonable way to approach this is to use (1) her clinical status, and (2) 'functional' imaging, such as Diamox SPECT, to follow her cerebrovascular disease.  I think intervention would be warranted if there were a deterioration in one of these parameters.



I have not yet heard from Howard Yelverton about his thoughts regarding the recent scan, but I did review the CT scans with neuroradiology.  Our impression is that, while the wording of the reports seems to suggest significant progression of the LICA stenosis, it's not significant enough to prompt us to act, in the absence of symptomatic or functional changes.



I am ordering a Diamox SPECT scan, since the previous one was in July of last year.



This is my last general neurology clinic at BMH; I will be a neuromuscular fellow here next year.  While I can be available for questions or concerns, I will be referring Betty's care to one of the more junior residents.

DATE OF BIRTH:  09/12/81.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 61-year-old ambidextrous female is referred by Dr. Orellana for followup of possible stroke or TIA.  The patient is interviewed and available records are reviewed.  In February, she developed left leg weakness on arising one morning.  There was also some possible ataxia of the left upper extremity with decreased control of both the arm and the leg.  This seemed to occur for two days in a row and on one occasion, she fell getting out of bed.  The symptoms resolved before she could be evaluated.  She attributed the symptoms to not enough air pressure in her air mattress and once this was corrected, she feels that the event has not re-occured.

The second event was apparently associated with some left facial weakness as well.

She was seen by Neurology on 02/10/43 after she was admitted.  The history includes also lightheadedness and foggy vision per that report.  Initially MRI of the head showed no acute events but did show a change in the right posterior cerebral artery and a lesion in the left temporal lobe.  Also, in the record is noted that at the time of the second event, her glucose was very low at around 32 and symptoms resolved after treatment with D50.  There was also further history that the patient had been seeing a chiropractor for treatment of neck pain in the several months leading up to the event.

On examination at the time of admission, there were no clear findings.  MRI was said to show periventricular white matter changes.  The area of abnormality adjacent to the left lateral ventricle was thought to perhaps represent an old prior small hemorrhage.  MRA of the brain showed absence of visualization of the right PCA about 1 cm beyond its origin but MRA of the neck showed no significant changes.  Subsequent echocardiogram showed mild LVH with no evidence of a shunt.

Currently, the patient is asymptomatic and presents for routine followup.  It has been unclear what the cause of her symptoms was.  Some have attributed the symptoms to hypoglycemia and another formulation was that of a thalamic TIA given the changes in the right PCA on MRA.  Another consideration was dissection from manipulation by the chiropractor.  There is no clinical history to go with the possible old small hemorrhage.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Notable for multifocal muscle aches and a chronic cough.  The patient also has some shortness of breath but there is no report of chest pain or fever or chills.  There are no medication allergies reported.

PAST FAMILY/SOCIAL HISTORY:  Past medical history is notable for hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, spinal stenosis, diabetes, depression, neuropathy, anxiety, COPD, arthritis, and sinus symptoms.

MEDICATIONS:  Lisinopril, Lopressor, glyburide, Naprosyn, Neurontin, Paxil, Lescol, Advair, trazodone, Glucophage, and ?___?.

Not withstanding the above, the patient continues to smoke.  She uses alcohol occasionally.  She has a 12th grade education.  She lives alone and is a widow.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Blood pressure is 148/86, pulse 83 and regular, respirations 20.  The patient is overweight.  Height is 5 foot 3 inches.  Weight is 217 pounds.  Range of motion of the neck is reduced in all quadrants, though without clear spasm.  Poor neck posture is noted.  Funduscopic examination is normal with regard to disks and vessels.  Cardiovascular testing, carotids are 2+ without bruits.  Temporal arteries are normal.  Musculoskeletal testing, gait and station show a slight slowing of gait that has been present for years.  Romberg is negative.  Tandem gait is normal.  The patient does move slowly in general, this is probably not reflective of true bradykinesia.  There is some asymmetry of the shoulders with elevation on the right compared with the left.  This affects movements of the arms and range of motion of the arms but it appears to be orthopedic in nature and not neurologic.  There is no focal muscle weakness or atrophy noted.

NEUROLOGICAL TESTING:  Mental status is essentially normal to orientation, memory, attention, language and fund of information.  Cranial nerve testing, pupils are 3 mm and briskly reactive.  Extraocular movements are full.  Visual fields are intact.  There is no facial sensory loss, but there is a mild facial asymmetry that did not look pathological.  Visual fields are intact.  Hearing is intact.  Oropharynx is normal.  Palate elevates well.  Tongue is midline.  Sensory testing shows absent vibration sensation in the feet bilaterally but sensory testing is otherwise intact.  Reflexes are absent in the lower extremities and 1+ in the upper extremities.  There is possible withdrawal at the left toe but the right toe seems downgoing.  Coordination testing today seemed intact.

Prior neurologic evaluation from 02/10/43 is reviewed.  Homocystine level was elevated at 14, normal zero to ten.  Recommended treatment included folate, pyridoxine, and B12.

IMPRESSION:  Transient neurologic symptoms, question etiology.  Comment.  I would agree with prior examiners that the symptoms probably do not relate to the position of the bed or air in the air mattress.  I do not think the symptoms are approximate enough to the chiropractic manipulation to be relevant.  Symptoms could have related to hypoglycemia or could have been vascular in nature.  In this regard, the PCA stenosis or occlusion may be relevant.  It is not immediately clear how to fit in the old hemorrhage.

PLAN:  Although, she should be on some type of antiplatelet agent.  She was on aspirin at the time of the event and therefore would be considered an aspirin failure.  We therefore suggested Plavix 75 mg daily.  We were subsequently called by the pharmacy and informed that she is already on Aggrenox.  It probably does not matter which medication she chooses; however, she should be on one or the other and not both.  For treatment of the homocysteine level elevation, we have added simply multivitamins two daily.  I am not sure how significant this finding is in relation to the above symptoms.  She is advised to watch her glucose level and adjust medicines accordingly.  We have suggested a followup in Neurology in six months.

REFERRING PHYSICIAN:  Armando Newton, M.D.

Mrs. Francesca Sergio-Steven is a 72-year-old Hispanic female who presents with a new-onset acute MI.  She has no known prior manifestations of coronary disease, but has a long history of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and hypertension.  She had been in her usual state of health until about 2 weeks ago, when she began to have episodes of chest discomfort.  She has only had two such episodes until the morning of admission, when she developed severe episode of chest pain at rest associated with shortness of breath.  She presented to the emergency room here where she was found to have new-onset ST-segment elevation in the inferior leads with a coving morphology involving the lateral leads as well.  There was also poor R-wave progression V1 through V3.  She was taken urgently to the cardiac catheterization laboratory, where she was found to have a markedly elevated wedge pressure at 30 mmHg with a normal cardiac index and blood pressure.  She had mid inferior wall and lateral wall akinesis initially with 3+ mitral regurgitation.  There was severe diffuse coronary disease with diffuse LAD disease and total occlusion of the proximal circumflex.  The right coronary artery was small with a 70% proximal stenosis.  The occluded circumflex was crossed with a wire and was stented with a Cypher drug-eluting stent.  She had an excellent result with the wedge also decreasing to 20 mmHg.  She had an estimated 70% ejection fraction despite the inferior and lateral akinesis.  Cardiac index was 2.5 with SVR of 1739.  She was then brought to the coronary care unit for further evaluation.

Her past medical history is notable for hypertension for which she takes lisinopril 40 mg q.d. and atenolol 50 mg q.d.  She also has insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and takes insulin.  Past medical history is also notable for a hysterectomy.

Social history is notable for no cigarette or alcohol use.  She is from Paraguay and has recently arrived in this country.

Review of systems show no fever, chills, nausea, or vomiting.

On exam, she is comfortable with a blood pressure initially 160/80 with a heart rate of 70 and regular.  Followup pressure 125/80 with a heart rate of 72 beats per minute.  Head and neck were unremarkable.  Chest is clear.  Cardiac exam shows no jugular venous distention at 30 degrees.  PMI is normal.  S1 and S2 were normal with a physiological split.  There is an S4 and a 1/6 systolic ejection murmur as well as a 1 to 2/6 holosystolic murmur and mitral regurgitation at the left lower sternal border.  There is no S3.  Abdominal exam was unremarkable without organomegaly.  Bowel sounds are normal.  Extremities showed no edema or cyanosis.  Calf site is clean without bruits.  Distal pulse is decreased but palpable.

Her resting 12-lead electrocardiogram shows evidence of her evolving inferolateral MI.

Other lab values included creatinine 1.0 with normal electrolytes, hematocrit is 44.4%, white blood cell count 3.8 with platelets 322,000.  Liver function tests are normal.

A portable chest x-ray shows pulmonary edema.

Mrs. Sergio-Steven clearly has evidence of an inferoposterior MI initially with a very high filling pressure and pulmonary edema and mitral regurgitation.  She has had her circumflex, which is a very large vessel, well treated now with a drug-eluting stent, and her wedge has come down, and her mitral regurgitation is substantially improved.

At this point, we will bring her to the coronary care unit for careful management with aspirin, Plavix, heparin, continue the Integrilin, as well as Lasix and nitrates.  We will plan to initiate afterload reduction as soon as tolerated, and also plan beta-blockade to limit her myocardial oxygen demands.  She certainly has co-existent quite substantial coronary disease including primarily the right coronary artery degree and to some degree the LAD.  At this point, if she were to have developed recurrent ischemia, we would proceed to consideration of bypass surgery.

She has a prolonged hospital course as well as rehab stay and now returns having made significant recovery.  Her PEG was pulled-out in 06/69.  She is here with her husband who is translating from columbian.  



I saw her about 1 month a go with hiperpigmentation of the skin, which I felt was melasma, and treated her with hydroquinone TP, sun blocking cream and avoidance of sun exposure.  Both she and her husband say tha her hiperpigmentation has decreased significantly.   



At present she has no symptoms and says she feels well.  She ambulates with a cane, and she is planning a 6-month trip to Columbia next October with her husband.

chest tightness since 11:00 a.m. and stated that she feels very

lousy after taking her meds and daily has been getting chest

tightness since her discharge recently in which she was admitted

for weakness and hypertensive urgency.  The patient stated that

she feels like a ""dead mouse.""  She admits to some headache,

dizziness and continued chest discomfort despite medications.

MULLINS,DOLORES U   728-41-92-0               VISIT DATE: 01/24/73

This patient was seen, interviewed and examined by myself as well 

as Dr. Hawkins whose note I reviewed and with which I agree.

HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  This is a 70-year-old female who 

presents with inability to control her left arm and left leg.  The 

patient had onset of her symptoms approximately two hours prior to 

arrival.  The patient denies any change in sensation but she 

definitely did notice weakness with decreased ability to control 

her left side extremities.  The patient states that her left arm 

control was regained after approximately one or two hours.  Her 

left leg control is better but still is not back to baseline.  

Review of systems, family history and social history as per the 

resident's note.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, 

hypertension.

MEDICATIONS:  Insulin, Diltiazem, labetalol.

ALLERGIES:  TETANUS.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  This is a well-developed, well-nourished 

female, in mild distress, appears concerned.  Temperature is 96.9 

degrees, pulse 65, respiratory rate of 18, blood pressure is 

163/104.  Repeat blood pressure is 174/80.  Oxygen saturation is 

97% on room air.  HEENT:  Normocephalic, atraumatic.  Pupils are 

equally round and reactive to light and accommodation.  Extraocular 

motions are intact.  No nystagmus.  NECK:  Supple with full range 

of motion.  2+ carotids, no bruits.  CARDIAC:  Regular rate and 

rhythm.  EXTREMITIES:  No clubbing, cyanosis or edema.  Extremities 

are nontender to palpation throughout.  NEURO:  Alert, oriented x 

3.  Follows commands, appropriate.  Cranial nerves II-XII are 

intact.  There is 5/5 motor strength in individual motor group 

testing of the upper extremities and lower extremities bilaterally. 

The patient is unable to stand without assistance.  Comprehension 

is within normal limits.  Further details of the physical 

examination are as per the resident's note.

LABORATORY EVALUATION:  Labs are significant for a glucose of 162, 

BUN of 20, creatinine 1.3, sodium 145, potassium 4.2, chloride 108, 

bicarb 26, calcium 9.4.  White count is 8.1, hematocrit 39.0, 

platelets 341.  A UA shows no blood, no leucocyte esterase, no 

ketones.  Head CT shows no acute intracranial abnormality and mild 

involutional changes.  EKG shows a sinus rhythm at 57 beats per 

minute with non-specific T wave changes.  This is compared to an 

EKG from 2068 and was found to be without significant change.

THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  The patient was seen and evaluated 

in the Emergency Department with labs and studies obtained as 

documented above.  The initial concerns were for a focal seizure 

versus a TIA.  The patient was hypertensive on her arrival and, 

therefore, received labetalol for improved blood pressure control 

and the Neurology Service was consulted early in the patient's 

care.  The patient does not have any evidence of focal motor group 

weakness at this time, nor sensation changes.  The patient will 

require admission to the Neurology Service for further workup of 

her seizure versus TIA.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  TIA.

DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  The patient is 

admitted to the hospital in satisfactory condition.

CHIEF PAIN COMPLAINT:  ""I have pain in the back radiating down my legs."" 

 

PAIN HISTORY:  The patient's pain started spontaneously about two years ago.  It is located in the lower back, radiating to the back of the legs, to the level of the knees.  The pain is brought on by walking and made better by stopping or sitting down.  Bending over forward also helps the pain.  There is no numbness or weakness associated with the pain.  The pain is better at night than during the day.  The patient has separate pain complaint, which is burning pain in her feet, is worse at night than during the day.  Patient denies bowel or bladder changes. The patient has tried Celebrex, Vioxx and Motrin but has not found any relief for her pain.  She currently does not take any pain medications.  She denies a history of heartburn, gastric or duodenal ulcers or GI bleeds.  She has trouble falling asleep and staying asleep because of the burning pain in her feet. She is being referred to us by Dr. Ebert from Neurosurgery after an MRI scan showed spinal stenosis at L5-S1 and at L4-5 as well as spondylolithiasis between L4 and L5.  She had been reluctant to undergo surgery and was therefore referred to see if epidural steroid injections could help.  

 

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease with myocardial infarction four years ago.   

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Coronary stent placement times two in December 2074.  

 

CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Metformin 500 mg q. day, Monopril 40 mg q.  day, baby aspirin 81 mg q. day,  HCTZ 12.5 mg q. day, Norvasc 5 mg q. day and Pravachol 20 mg q. day.

 MANAMANA nfectious Disease Consultation Note

Patient: Vincent Ware (71417347     2Y)
Student:  Casey Best, MS-4
ID Fellow: Tina Isaiah-Villagomez MD
ID Attending: Alexander Y Xian MD
Referring Physician: Webster MD
Date of Consult: September 20, 2073

Reason for consult:  cough, nightsweats and weightloss, two days prior to transplant

HPI: 66 yo M with h/o IDDM, large cell lymphoma in 2066, and now with myelodysplastic syndrome.  He was treated with CHOP in 2066 followed by radiotherapy, completed in Nov 2066.  He was free of disease since then until May 2073.  He sought primary care for a URI and was noted to be anemic (HCT 31).  His counts were followed and when his HCT dropped as low as 22 a Bone Marrow was done and showed myelodysplastic syndrome.  He was considered for a allogenic stem-cell transplant.  His major complaint is a dry cough that he has had since May 2073.   It is provoked by eating, drinking and lying down.  And only occasionally does he produce any sputum.  He has been on numerous antibiotics in the past four months for the cough and he also developed a periorbital cellulitis for which he was hospitalized at Educare-Fargo for which he received a 3 week course of Ceftriaxone, Nafcillin and flagyl (finished at the end of July).  In retrospect, he recognizes sinus pressure/congestion associated with periorbital cellulitis.  In August 2073 he had a questionable LLL PNA and was treated with cipro.  On pre-transplant work-up, CXR revealed increase    conspicuity of ill-defined LL zone opacity.      CT chest reviewed today revealed mutlifocal pneumonia with associated radiation-related changes.  

Throughout this time period he has only had a few days of fever for which he was at KCGH and given abx and defervesced.  He recalls    nightsweats    as the fevers broke.  He does admit to maybe a 10 lb weight loss in the past 4 months.  He denies SOB (unless he   s severely anemic), orthopnea, sore throat, dysphagia, odynophagia, CP, palpitations, angina-like symptoms, acid-reflux, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, BRBPR, dysuria, frequency, nocturia, joint or muscle pain.  He does have mild peripheral neuropathy in his feet bilaterally.

      IMPRESSION: Chest PA and lateral views are compared to prior  done on 9/18/2073. Paramediastinal opacification is changed.  Cardiomediastinal silhoutte is stable. Nodular opacity in the  left perihilar region appears less apparent. No new consolidations are seen. There is a new left-sided Hickman catheter with its tip in the SVC. No pneumothorax is seen .
      
Impression:
66 yo M with h/o IDDM, large cell lymphoma in 2066, and now with myelodysplastic syndrome who presents with fourth months of cough of unclear etiology.

The differential diagnosis is broad and includes both infectious and non-infectious diagnoses.  Our leading diagnosis is either radiation fibrosis or a primary interstitial lung disease, such as COP.  However, we also think that several infectious etiologies should be considered.  Endemic mycoses (histo, blasto and crypto), cryptococcal pneumonia, nocardiasis, aspergillus, mucormycosis and MAC are some diseases to consider in this patient.  While the clinical picture of granulomas on chest CT and cough is consistent with the diagnosis of mycobacterial disease, the patient is very low risk for this infection and his lack of fevers, progressive weight loss and systemic illness argues against this diagnosis.  

I (AYX) have interviewed and examined Mr. Ware, and confirmed all of the findings documented in this note.   My highest suspicion is for an inflammatory process, such as radiation pneumonitis or BOOP/COP.  An occult infection is quite possible, such as pulmonary MAC or a mold (the lesion in his left lower lobe is especially suspicious).  Clinically he is unchanged over many months, so empiric antibiotics would not be indicated.    

 We recommend the following work-up:

-Expectorated sputum for gram stain and culture
-Induced sputum for
-PCP
-Modified AFB smear (looking for Nocardia)
-Fungal stain and culture
-Urine histo antigen
-Serum cryptococcal antigen
-Weekly monitoring of galactomannan and D-glucan
-Nasopharyngeal swab for respiratory viral panel (RSV, Adenovirus, Influenza A and B, paraflu A and B) and viral culture

If the above work-up is unrevealing, please consult pulmonology for a bronchoscopy -- sooner rather than later.

It is reasonable to start is levaquin 500 mg QD now to treat empirically for typical and atypical pathogens (this medication is scheduled to begin in two days, per protocol).

Our recommendations were communicated to Dr. Dalton and Dr. Robin Jeffery of the patient   s primary team.  Thank you for this consult.  Our team will follow with you

Mr Gallegos is here in clinic for follow-up of his recent hospitalization for chest pain.  He was seen in clinic on 11/18 and sent to emergency unit due to unstable angina and ECG changes.  He had a cardiac catheterization which showed inferior lateral reversible defect.  He had two stents to the RCA.  He had a right groin stick.  He has a right groin pressure dressing and  the area is slightly tender. He has no lower extremity symptoms. His medications were changed to Plavix, Toprol-XL, lisinopril, aspirin, simvastatin.  
Patient is now currently off his diabetes medications including insulin.  His recent hemoglobin A1c was 6% down from 16%.  He continues to follow a diabetic diet.  His blood sugars are less than 150.  He has no other complaints.  His medical record was reviewed in detail.


Exam:

MICRO:



CXR:  Clear lungs.



CTA 8/11/94: The patient is status post infrarenal abdominal aortic endograft

placement. No endoleak is identified. The left limb of the graft is occluded throughout its entire extent.  There is mural thrombus identified in the proximal aspect of the graft circumferentially.	The left limb is again noted to extend into the left external iliac artery.  The distal right limb terminates in the right	common iliac artery. There is a normally patent right to left femoral femoral bypass graft. The aneurysm sac, previously measuring 55 x 51 mm, now measures 53 x 50 mm.



ECHO 2/94: EF > 50% Trace to mild mitral regurgitation. There are thin mobile echoes associated with the aortic valve leaflets most c/w Lambl's excresence.  There is no evidence of aortic insufficiency by color or spectral Doppler.  There are atheroma in the aorta but no protruding or mobile components.The left ventricular cavity size is normal.  The left ventricular systolic function is within normal limits.There is a very small circumferential pericardial effusion.  There is evidence of a large pleural effusion.



EGD 1/94: - Savary-Miller Grade III reflux esophagitis.

EKG:  Sinus rhythm w/ 1st degree AV block. Q in I, AVL, and II, II, AVF.  T wave inversion in V2-V6.  

 



___________________________________________



Impression:

70 yo man with history of CAD, AAA repair, vasculopath, presents with GI bleed most likely secondary to gastric ulcer, EKG changes with fast rhythm, bump in cardiac enzymes.





Plan: 

GI Bleed

-	NPO

-	Repeat EGD 48 hrs

-	Follow HCT q 6h and transfuse for HCT<30

-	Acid suppression w/ IV zantac

-	Received FFP/Vit K to reverse coumadin

-	will check H. pylori serologies

PVD

-	Will have to monitor extremities w/ acute reversal of anticoagulation

-	Will need to restart anticoagulation once stable from GI perspective

CV

Ischemia

-	Patient w/ EKG changes in setting of arrest.  Trend CKs

-	Holdng ASA

-	follow EKG's

-	unable to give beta-blockade at the moment due to low BP

-	history of elevated troponins due to CKD

Pump

		BP borderline with low HCT, required Levo to keep pressures up for sedation

	

Pulm

-	may have aspirated in setting of arrest, CXR clear though

-	will hold Abx at this time.  If WBC rises or spikes w/ begin antibiotics

-	required vent support briefly with sedation



Access

-	will need to change femoral lines to IJ since placed emergently during code



CKD: Acute renal insult on top of CKD. Creatinine responded to volume (PRBCs and fluid).

ID: is supposed to be on chronic suppressive doxycycline for history of MRSA, but at the moment no meds PO, so will hold

Prophylaxis: Head of bed should be 30 degrees, pneumoboots, Zantac.

CARDIOLOGY

PORT HURON HOSPITAL



Reason for visit:

   77 year old woman with mitral stenosis, S/P redoMVR for thrombosed St. Jude valve, now with porcine MVR, AS, COPD, S/P R total hip replacement.



Interval History:

   Mrs. Mitchell has hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, mitral stenosis, aortic stenosis, hypertension and COPD.  She had a mitral valve replacement with the St. Jude's valve and septal myomectomy in 2085. Because of thrombosis of the valve with recurrent heart failure, she had a redo mitral valve replacement complicated by sinus arrest and AV nodal block requiring a permanent pacemaker.  She also had several episodes of syncope, once after taking an additional dose of Lasix and another in the setting of over diuresis. Repeat echo showed that her AS was not critical and she had significant LV outflow tract obstruction.

			

Other medical problems include severe COPD, trigeminal neuralgia, ruled out for temporal arteritis by several biopsies, R hip osteonecrosis, and bone spur of the right shoulder. Mrs. Mitchell is S/P total hip replacement surgery, and had her rehab atNorth Mountain Hospital. She had intercurrent admissions for overdiuresis and for flash pulmonary edema with over- and under-diuresis, respectively. She currently takes Bumex 6 mg po bid, and with this, her weight has been 140-145 pounds, which is her target weight. Her BUN and Cr are in the 25-40/1.3-1.7 range. 



Since her last visit, she has done well at home. Her breathing at home is intermittently difficult, especially if she rushes. However, oximetry shows that she is in the mid 90's at rest, and that she drops down to high 80's to 90 with exertion. She has had GI evaluation for anemia in the past, only revealing diverticulosis; her Hct was 28 recently, and Dr. Conway arranged for her to udnergo transfusion of one unit of PRBC. She feels more energetic after this. She takes Fe sulfate, but has some constipation from this.



She may require ENT surgery for vocal cord growth by Dr. Cherry. This is being considered in consultation with her LMD Dr. Evelyn Conway, and her pulmonologist Dr. Geoffrey Lucas.

INTERPRETATION:



FEV1 and FEV1/FVC are reduced, FVC is normal. TLC is normal. FRC is normal.

RV is increased.  RV/TLC ratio is increased. Resistance is increased;

specific conductance is decreased. Single breath diffusion capacity is

severely reduced, although there was only one adequate maneuver performed and

thus reproducibility cannot be assured. DL/VA is reduced. These data

demonstrate a mild obstructive ventilatory deficit. The spirometry obtained

today are similar to those from 12/14/2092. Resting room air oxygen

saturation is below normal limits, and there is significant arterial oxygen

desaturation with exertion.

Assessment and plan:

   77 year old woman S/P redo-MVR, AS, CHF, COPD, S/P R hip replacement.



Problems:



Congestive heart failure -  Her LV outflow tract obstruction and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is well compensated with metoprolol and verapamil SR. She cannot tolerate ACE inhibitors because of her severe aortic stenosis. Continue diuresis with bumex 6 mg po bid. Good BUN and Cr, weight close to target, overall euvolemic.





Chronic obstructive lung disease -  Followed by Dr. Lucas. PFT's stable.

EDVISIT^25816492^Uher, Olga^10/16/73^BALL, MILDRED

The patient was seen in conjunction with resident Dr. Sharp. 

The resident's note reviewed.  The patient was seen and examined

by me.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Briefly, this is a 62-year-old woman

who has had decrease in mental status and activity since 3 days

ago.  She has had some fevers off and on.  Temperature ranging

between 100 and 101.3.  Her blood sugar has been 300-500.  She

reports a decrease in energy.  She has end-stage renal disease on

hemodialysis Sunday, Tuesday, and Thursday.  She had her dialysis

today but has much less energy than usual.  She has a cough, no

nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea, has constipation, takes lactulose,

and has a normal bowel movement.  Last BM was Thursday evening. 

This is a normal spacing of her usual bowel movements.  According

to her visiting nurse, the urine looks dark.  Blood pressure is

running in the low 100 in the last month.  Change in mental

status for 5 days means that she is not as talkative as usually

is.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY, SOCIAL HISTORY, AND REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: 

Reviewed, confirmed, and notable for history of high cholesterol,

arthritis, insulin-dependent diabetes, retinopathy, renal

failure, foot ulcers, and hypothyroidism.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She was in an acute care facility as a nurse

coming regularly.  The patient arrives to the hospital with a

DNR/DNH order, which near the end of her visit once the family

arrived, we got the information that this order has been and

rescinded by the family in the past.  This is noted nowhere in

her chart.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Negative except as noted above.

MEDICATIONS:  The patient takes methylphenidate, Ambien,

Prilosec, Ultram, verapamil, PhosLo, Coumadin, Renax, Colace, and

olanzapine.

ALLERGIES:  She is allergic to NSAIDs.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She has a fever of 100.3, pulse of 95,

respirations 24, blood pressure 85/53, and saturating 90% on room

air and 100% on 3 liters.  She has facial asymmetry which nurse

believes is baseline.  Neck is supple and nontender.  She has no

elevated JVP.  Respirations are bilateral basilar crackles with

Peculiar, NE  54583

Dear Dr. Berg:

We had the pleasure of caring for your patient, Jarome Dejesus, during his admission to the Erie County Infirmary from 07/16/2157 to 07/17/2157 for evaluation and treatment of his anginal symptoms.  As you know, Mr. Dejesus is a very pleasant 74-year-old gentleman with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation who is on Coumadin.  He has a history of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, hypertension and dyslipidemia.  He has known coronary artery disease and underwent stenting of his left anterior descending artery in 05/2155, at which time he had a Taxus drug-eluting stent placed.  He returns now with increasing dyspnea on exertion and had an elective cardiac catheterization performed at the Southwest Colorado Medical on 07/13/2157 that showed focal 90% instent restenosis in the left anterior descending artery with no other focally occlusive disease.  He was transferred to the Erie County Infirmary and on the afternoon of 07/16/2157, Dr. Yoseph Flint was able to dilate and stent the lesion in the left anterior descending artery with placement of a 3.5 x 28 mm Cypher drug-eluting stent.  The procedure was complicated by brief transient no re-flow that resolved immediately to intracoronary nitroglycerin.  The left femoral arteriotomy was closed using an Angio-Seal device.  Mr. Dejesus has spent an uneventful evening on our Cardiovascular Service.  He has had no complaints of chest pain or shortness of breath.  He is ambulating, eating, and voiding without difficulty.

His heart rate has been in the 70s, blood pressure in the 110s/60.  He is in atrial fibrillation.  His cardiac exam was irregular with no appreciable murmur.  His lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.  His left groin is moderately ecchymotic but soft.  There is no hematoma or bruit.  Extremities are warm and well perfused.

His morning labs revealed a sodium of 138, potassium of 4.9, BUN of 21, creatinine of 1.2.  His total CK is 58 with a CK-MB of 0.4.  His hematocrit is stable at 38, white count of 9, platelets of 300,000.  His fasting lipid panel showed a total cholesterol 123 with an HDL of 25, LDL of 49, and triglycerides of 244.

We are discharging him home on the following medications:  Plavix 75 mg p.o. daily, which must be continued for a minimum of the next three months, aspirin 325 mg p.o. daily is to be backed off to 81 mg after a few months.  He will resume his Coumadin at 5 mg daily, and have this checked with his primary care physician, Dr. Paige.  He will be on Lipitor 20 mg p.o. daily, digoxin 0.25 mg p.o. daily, Tikosyn 500 mcg p.o. b.i.d., glyburide 5 mg p.o. daily, Avandia 4 mg p.o. daily, Diovan 80 mg p.o. daily, NPH insulin 16 units each evening and sublingual nitroglycerin to be used as needed for chest pain.  We have asked him to arrange a followup appointment with you within the next couple of weeks and to see Robert-Joseph Paige in the near future also.  Thank you very much for allowing us to participate in the care of this pleasant gentleman, and please do not hesitate to contact us with any issues regarding his ongoing management.

With warmest regards.

Sincerely,

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Stroke.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 72-year-old right-handed
woman with a history of hypertension, diabetes, and
hypercholesterolemia who was admitted to the Neurology Service on
06/18/2067 with right-arm weakness and difficulty speaking.  She
presented to the Emergency Room 5.5 hours after last seeming
normal.  Her initial NI stroke scale was 11.  She was admitted to
the Neurology Service for a stroke workup.  Her imaging studies
showed a left MCA infarct involving the left corona radiata, head
of the caudate basal ganglia, and an MI cutoff on the CTA and MRA
in addition to a left ICA occlusion.  She was taken to angiogram
for interventional neuroradiology.  She had an angiogram. 
Radiology felt they were unable to access the
cause and no intervention was attempted and the patient was
admitted to the Neuro ICU for blood pressure monitoring and
hypertensive therapy.  She remained stable anti-coagulated on
heparin.  During the hospital stay, she spontaneously converted
to rapid ventricular rate atrial fibrillation, which was felt to
be the likely source of her stroke and as such was planned to
remain anti-coagulated.  She was discharged to rehab and
subsequently went home from rehab on 08/04/2067.  At home, she
had been noted to have elevations in blood pressure but has been
feeling O.K.  VNA sees her once a week.  At rehab, for unclear
reasons, her warfarin was discontinued and in speaking to the
discharging physician from the Tracy Medical Clinic, this was
done for a question of vaginal bleeding although the patient is
unaware of any such problems.  She continues to get PT and
occupational therapy twice per week and complains that her memory
remains poor.  According to the family member and her daughter
who are here interpreting for her at Clinic today, she continues
to have right-sided weakness, although significantly improved and
decreased verbal output although her daughter seemed to be able
to communicate well with her.  Since her discharge, she has not
had any new episodes of numbness, weakness, headaches, or visual
changes.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  She denies any fevers, chills, weight loss,
chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, leg cramps,
claudication, dyspnea on exertion, cough, wheezing, hemoptysis,
heartburn, abdominal pain, hematemesis, nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea, melena, dysuria, changes in bowel or bladder habits,
rashes, arthralgias, myalgias, polyuria, polydypsia, breathing,
or bleeding problems.  Review of neurological systems as above.  

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension, diabetes, and elevated
cholesterol.

MEDICATIONS:  Metoprolol, Zoloft, Zocor, and Captopril.

ALLERGIES:  She has no known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives in Castle Rock with her son. 
No history of tobacco or alcohol.

FAMILY HISTORY:  A sister had a stroke.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Her blood pressure was 150/80, her heart
rate was 70, respiratory rate of 12.  General:  Pleasant woman in
no acute distress.  HEENT:  Atraumatic, normocephalic, sclera
anicteric, and oropharynx is clear.  There is no thyromegaly. 
Neck:  Supple, no bruits, with 2+ carotids.  Heart:  Regular rate
and rhythm.  Lungs:  Clear to auscultation.  Abdomen:  Has good
bowel sounds, soft, nontender, no hepatosplenomegaly. 
Extremities:  No clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.  Skin:  No rashes
or ulcers.  Neurological exam (conducted via her daughter and the
interpreter):  She is alert and oriented.  She is attentive.  She
is non-fluent with really minimal verbal output.  She has
decreased naming and decreased comprehension.  She does not have
any neglect or apraxia.  Registration is 3/4.  Short-term memory
is 0/4 in 5 minutes.  Pupils are 3 and reactive to 2 millimeters.
 Fundi are normal.  Extraocular movements are intact with
nystagmus.  Visual fields are full to confrontation.  She has a
right facial droop.  Facial sensation is intact.  Hearing is
normal.  Motor exam:  There is increased muscle tone on the right
arm and leg.  She has strength on the left is normal.  On the
right, her strength is at least 4/5 in all muscle groups on the
left on the neck, except for about 3/5 in the distal arm.  She
reports decreased pinprick and temperature on the right arm. 
There is no ataxia on the left.  Gait is slow, walks with a cane,
and so conducts the right leg.  Her reflexes are brisker on the
right at about 3 and she has a right plantar extensor response.  

IMAGING DATA:  Initial head CT on 06/18/2067 did not show any
acute stroke or hemorrhage.  On the CT, there was a question of a
left MI cutoff.  CT angiogram also showed a distal left ICA
stenosis with minimal distal interflow.  MRI of the brain showed
a left MCA infarction involving the left corona radiata, head of
the caudate basal ganglia.  She has had mild to moderate chronic
small vessel ischemic changes on her MRI.  Echo showed a normal
EF of 55% without any clot, no PFO.  

IMPRESSION:  This is a 73-year-old woman with significant
vascular risk factors, including paroxysmal atrial fibrillation
with a left ICA MCA clot resulting in a left MCA territory
infarct.  On exam, she has residual aphasia involving both
comprehension and fluency; and a moderate right hemiparesis.  It
is unclear to me why the warfarin was discontinued but given her
stroke and the documentation of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation
during her hospital stay, I think that she would benefit from
anti-coagulation therapy.  I have asked her to get a follow up
PCP evaluation at the OCH to determine if indeed there are
any contraindications to anti-coagulation.  If there are no such
contraindications, she should restart on warfarin.  In addition,
her blood pressure is still not well controlled and I would ask
her to increase her Captopril to 12.5 mg t.i.d. and to maintain a
blood pressure diary.  

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1.  Continue anti-hypertensive and increase Captopril to 12.5 mg
t.i.d.
2.  Blood pressure diary for next clinic appointment.
3.  Continue risk factor modification with the management of
blood pressure, diabetes, and hypercholesterol as she is doing.
4.  PCP evaluation for question of bleeding problem during rehab
stay and resumption of warfarin if there are no contraindications
per the PCP.
5.  Continue physical therapy and occupation therapy for gait
training and language rehab.
6.  Return to clinic in 6 months or sooner if there are any new
problems.

More than 50% of this clinic visit was spent on patient education
and counseling.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 58-year-old white male comes to the office for followup regarding his recent chest pain.


Chest pain.  The patient was in his usual state of compensated health, but approximately one month ago after clearing significance note from his driveway, the patient started to note some anterior chest discomfort.  He has a long history of coronary artery disease and this includes angioplasty and coronary artery bypass grafting in 2065.  The pain did not radiate up to his neck or arm, but when the pain persisted even after returning from Blountstown, he went to Roper Hospital North two days ago because of his chest discomfort to see his cardiologist.  He was admitted to the hospital, had a cardiac catheterization, which according to the patient did not show any specific lesion.  The doctors felt that he did not have a myocardial infarction, but that in fact his abnormality was due to a chest wall/muscular type syndrome.  He was discharged on anti-inflammatory medicine and the patient had noted that when he took the aspirin over the past month, his discomfort was improved.  The patient states that he had the chest x-rays at the hospital and in fact also had a CT scan, which did not show any pulmonary embolism.  It also did not show any dissecting aneurysm according to the patient.


Left renal lesion.  As part of his routine workup, the patient did have a CT scan and this identified some left kidney mass possibly on this scan.  The patient denies specifically any flank pain or any bleeding and he has no recent weight loss.  I spoke to the patient at length about this matter and he will consult with Dr. Jung, the urologist at Roper Hospital North.


Diabetes mellitus type 2.  The patient remains on his usual medicines and according to him, his hemoglobin A1c and blood sugars have remained fairly satisfactory.


Obstructive sleep apnea.  The patient does not use his mask and I cautioned him to get back using that, as this may have an effect on his coronary artery disease.


Abnormal liver function tests, has been present for many years and previously was thought to be due to a fatty liver.


Elevated blood pressure.  The patient was noted in the hospital to have elevated blood pressures despite his medicine and he was asked to increase his Norvasc from 5 mg to 10 mg per day.


Gastroesophageal reflux.  The patient feels well on Zantac.


REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Reveals no specific headaches.  He denies any trouble with his ears, nose or throat.  He has no chronic cough or coughing blood.  He denies any nausea, vomiting, black or bloody stool.  He has no burning on urination.


PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Revealed a pleasant white male in no acute distress.  His blood pressure was 130/90, pulse was 60 and weight 207 pounds.  Head, ears, eyes, nose and throat were normal.  The neck showed no thyroid nodes or tenderness.  The chest did show a healed coronary artery bypass graft scar, but he did have chest wall discomfort to palpation in the costochondral area on the left.  The lungs were clear to percussion and auscultation.  Heart showed a regular sinus rhythm.  Abdomen is soft.  No liver or spleen was felt.  Extremities showed no cyanosis, clubbing or edema.  Neurologically, the patient was alert.


The patient was also sent to the office for evaluation because of his kidney function and the use of the scan during the CT scanning and use of the diet.


The patient was therefore ordered to have routine laboratory test including complete blood count, CBC, chem profile, lipid profile, urinalysis and I did a hemoglobin A1c because of his history of diabetes.


1.  Chest pain, probably due to chest wall rather than coronary artery disease according to the patient's history.
2.  New discovery of left renal mass to consult with Urology, Dr. Jung.
3.  Renal function to be rechecked secondary to his CT scanning and history of diabetes with Glucophage, which he has restarted.
4.  Status post coronary artery bypass graft.
5.  Abnormal LFTs by history.
6.  Diabetes mellitus.
7.  Obstructive sleep apnea.


Will follow up with the patient by phone tomorrow regarding his lab tests and also he will consult with Dr. Jung and has a followup appointment with me for comprehensive exam in one to two months.

NAME:     Upham, Zelda
MRN:      0308696

The patient is here for a scheduled visit, status post hospitalization for emergent
bypass surgery.  She is late for the visit.  She is accompanied by her daughter,
Qazi.  The patient denies chest pain and has done quite well, based on reports
from her rehab stay at the Miller County Hospital.  Currently complaining of
left-sided chest wall pain. No exertional chest pain and no shortness of breath.  Has
an appointment pending with her cardiologist tomorrow.  Also has an appointment
pending with surgeon Dr. Weeks for 12/13/95. Has been compliant with
medications.  

The patient's daughter is concerned that the patient is not eating enough.  Has lost
significant weight since hospitalization.  Patient did agree that she has been watching
what she eats because she did not want to gain much weight.  Explained to her the
importance of proper nutrition and getting back her strength.  

Asked if she can use an OTC pain patch called Salonpas. Says that the chest wall
tenderness is very different from any exertional chest pain that she may have had in
the past.  Would like some relief for this.  Uses it on her knees and finds it helpful
for the arthritic knee pain. 

Emotionally, the patient did admit to feeling depressed and did become tearful
during the visit. 

PROBLEMS: See extensive LMR list. 

MEDICATIONS:  See LMR list. 

ALLERGIES:  Sulfa, Percocet and quinine. 

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Well-appearing female. Vital signs: WNL, as per flow
sheet. Lungs: Clear with rales. COR: RRR, S1 and S2 without murmurs noted. 

ASSESSMENT:

(1)  CAD: The patient is also on a cholesterol-lowering agent, but will update list
     at next visit.  Keep appointment with cardiologist. 

(2)  Chest wall tenderness status post CABG: Tried to encourage patient that there
     will be some persistent discomfort in her wound for several months.  Told her
     to hold off on using the OTC pain patch until I can verify the ingredients. 

(3)  Depressed mood status post surgery: Refuses referral to Mental Health. Not
     suicidal. Encouraged patient to eat more regularly. 

(4)  Return to clinic for follow-up in two weeks.  

This visit lasted for 35 minutes, half of which was spent trying to counsel the patient
to obtain proper nutrition and to go to Mental Health.  I was unsuccessful in
convincing her to attend a Mental Health session.

The patient was seen in conjunction with the resident, Dr.

Vue.  Resident's note was reviewed.  The patient was seen and

examined by me.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Briefly, this is a 73-year-old woman

with extensive cardiac history of hypertension and coronary

artery disease, IMI with any EF 40%, history of V-TACH, high

cholesterol, insulin-dependent diabetes, and status post AICD

cardiac catheterization and in the past.  The patient was in the

Emergency Department today visiting a family member.  She was

completely asymptomatic, but had her blood pressure taken which

showed a pressure of 190/98.  The patient states that she usually

takes 9 cardiac and antihypertensive medicines but the

prescriptions has run out and so for the past week or so, she has

been taking only 4 of the 9.  She is unable to say exactly which

ones.  She denies any headache, visual changes, chest pain,

shortness of breath, palpitations, dizziness, or lightheadedness.

 Her husband is the one in the Emergency Department today and

that is causing her some stress.  Denies any rash, joint pain,

back pain, polyuria, or polydipsia.

Please see the resident's note for details of the patient's past

medical history, surgical history, family history, review of

systems, and physical exam.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She is awake, alert, in no distress with

no complaints.  Has a repeat blood pressure of 190/95 and

saturating 99% on room air with a pulse of 70.  Exam is

remarkable for a systolic ejection murmur at the right upper

sternal border of 3/6.  No JVD, with good and equal pulses. 

Abdomen is soft and nontender.  She has no papilledema and fundal

exam is clear.  Neurologically, she is oriented x3 with normal

mood and affect.

IMAGING STUDIES:  EKG shows first-degree AV block with an old

LAD.  This is considered normal for this patient and is unchanged

from before.  Urinary dip is negative.

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  The patient's usual pharmacy is

contacted.  Correct doses of her medications are obtained and

refills for 2 weeks were given.  She is told to follow up with

her primary care physician within 2 weeks.  She says she will be

able to do that and remains asymptomatic throughout her Emergency

Department stay.  At one point during her stay, her blood

pressure went up to as high as 209/98, however, on my last

recheck, just prior to the patient leaving, the pressure was

185/90.  The patient's primary care physician was contacted about

this and agrees to follow up with the patient within 3 days.

DISPOSITION:  The patient is discharged home in satisfactory

condition.

MSH Adult Medicine Office Visit                              PCP Dr Whitehead



73 yr old woman with HTN, SP CABG, fibromyalgia comes in for follow up of renal MRA done for evaluation of renal insufficiency and associated high K.

She was hospitalized in 7/97 for a fairly acute deterioration of renal function and hyperkalemia.  At that time she was told to DC Lisinopril and Vioxx.  Her renal function seemed to improve with that intervention though in early August her K+ rose a bit.  The VNA has been seeing her at home.  According to the patient her BP has been ""normal"".

She and her daughter come in now to review results of the recent renal MRA.  They are seeing me because there  were no appts available for her with her PCP.  

She denies any chest pain, shortness of breath.  Appetite is good.

She has been trying to avoid foods high in potassium but she is not sure about K+ content of many foods.

She has been taking Lisinopril at the same dose since her CBG in 2095 and has been taking NSAIDs for fibromyalgia for several years.

According to discharge summary of hospitalization in 7/97, urine was negative for eosinophils.



A:  73 yr old with HTN has had deterioration of renal function since 2095 when she began taking ACEi concomitantly with NSAID.  The cause for more acute deterioration of renal function in 7/2097 and again in early August is unclear.

She has not been taking any NSAID including OTC forms. 

I don't think the moderate renal artery stenosis is a significant contributor to renal dysfunction and her BP is reasonable off the ACEi.  



P:  Her daughter had many questions about what this type of ""blockage"" means and about prognosis.  

I attempted to explain the differences between renal perfusion, renal function, and to advise her about the role/impact of ACEi for BP and her heart (her daughter is worried that her heart will suffer if she doesn't take the ACEi).  

I told her that it is unsafe for her to take any NSAID. 

I suggested that a renal specialist would be helpful in determining the role of renal artery disease in her renal dysfunction.

Provided her with detailed lists of low and high K+ foods.

Check lytes, renal function, Phos, Ca and Alb today.

Will discuss Nephrology consultation with Dr Whitehead.



She has an appt with Dr Whitehead on 8/27.



Length of visit was 45 minutes.

Identification:  Patient is a 53-year old markedly obese female 
complaining of bilateral weight knee pain.  She denies any morning 
stiffness, any jelling phenomena.  She has had no trauma or effusions in 
the knee.  She had noted on x-ray many years ago that she had had a 
chipped bone in the right knee and some mild osteoarthritis but it has 
bothered her only intermittently until this year.  Last year she did go 
to Briggs Stratton and dropped to 270 lb. at which point her knees felt 
better, but currently she is back up to over 300 lb. and at her height 
of 5 ft. 1 in., she is in pain.  She has not visited a physician.  She 
has no internist who currently checks on her general medical health, but 
she does report that the occasional Advil she takes does produce some 
dyspepsia.  She has no history of gout, no history of psoriasis, no 
history of pseudogout or any rash, alopecia, headaches, shoulder or hip 
discomfort.  She does not complain of back pain but does have difficult 
walking 50 yards because of the knee pain.
 
Allergies:  None.
 
Medications:  Occasional Advil.
 
Past Surgical History:  Cholecystectomy 2064.  Two c-sections.
 
Past Medical History:  Negative for hypertension, diabetes, cancer, 
stroke, tuberculosis, hepatitis, asthma, heart disease.
 
Family History:  Mother is alive and well with no medical problems.  
Father is alive and well with no medical problems.  She has 12 siblings.  
One sibling died of pneumonia at a young age.  Another sibling has 
asthma.
 
Physical Examination;  She is a markedly obese female, no apparent 
distress.  She is 5 ft. 1 in. and weighs 304 lb.  Examination of joints:  
No evidence of active synovitis or pain in her DIPs, PIPs, MCPs, wrists, 
elbows, shoulders.  Bilateral hips are limited in internal external 
rotation but not because of pain-- due to obesity, bilateral knees have 
crepitus, but no warmth or swelling.  There is some pain at extremes of 
flexion on the left of 110 degrees.  Ankles and toes within normal 
limits.  Please note above in the clinical history that she does not 
complain of back pain but does have difficult walking 50 yards because 
of the knee pain.  The blood pressure could not be taken secondary to 
the fact that the large blood pressure 
cuff did not fit around her right arm. 
 
Impression:  
 
1.   Probable bilateral osteoarthritis.  I will obtain plain films and 
     have prescribed Disalcid 3 gm. a day p.r.n.   GI and renal side 
     effects explained.
                                              2-03-68
 
 
 
2.   We discussed seriously the need for weight loss.  She will be 
     referred to the nutritionist to get on a weight loss program.  She 
     will seriously entertain a weight loss program.  Patient will 
     return in a few months unless she has any further problems.
 
3.   I have referred her to an Internal Medicine doctor for health maintenance since 
     she does not have one as yet.

Dear Dr. Dill:



DOB:  10/11/2082



Thank you for referring Mr. Dejesus to the Erie County Arrhythmia Service for consideration of catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation.



As you know him well, I will summarize his history briefly for our records.  Mr. Dejesus is a 78-year-old gentleman with an extensive cardiac history that includes coronary artery disease status post multiple percutaneous coronary interventions and stents to the LAD as well as RCA territories, a cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of approximately 35-40%, and atrial fibrillation.  In addition, he has multiple cardiac risk factors including diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and obstructive sleep apnea.  In addition to disease in his coronary vascular bed, he has a history of carotid disease status post left CEA.



He came to your attention early this year with symptoms of exertional dyspnea.  On further questioning, he reports feeling quite symptomatic when ambulating relatively short distances around his home or up and down the driveway.  He can walk no further than approximately 50-100 feet before developing significant shortness of breath and fatigue.  He was recently diagnosed as having paroxysmal atrial fibrillation that has transitioned to persistent.  He has undergone multiple cardioversions most recently in 03/19/2161, but was unsuccessful.  Prior to that, cardioversion in February resulted in a brief period of restoration of sinus rhythm during which time he felt symptomatically improved.  He also describes occasional fleeting episodes of sharp left-sided chest discomfort.  Cardiac catheterization on 01/18/2161 revealed a 30% LAD in-stent restenosis, 90% septal lesion, and 65% -70% PDA lesion that was stented.  A Ventriculogram at that time revealed an EF of 35-40%.



Other than significant exertional shortness of breath, he feels relatively well.  He has occasional symptoms of orthostatic lightheadedness but no history of syncope.  He denies any PND, orthopnea, or lower extremity swelling.  He has no history of heart failure hospitalizations.  His weight has been stable.



On review of systems, he denies any fevers, chills, or night sweats.  His weight has remained stable.  He denies any new onset cough, wheezing, or hemoptysis.



Past Medical History:

1.  CAD status post LAD PCI/stenting in 2155.  He developed in-stent restenosis in 07/2157, during which time he received a second drug-eluting stent to the LAD lesion.  He developed recurrent chest discomfort in 12/2159, and he underwent cardiac catheterization during which time he was found to have an 80% mid LAD lesion distal to his prior stents as well as a 30% proximal RCA mid PDA stenosis.  He underwent a drug-eluting stent to the mid LAD lesion.  A followup catheterization in 01/2161 revealed a 30% LAD stenosis, 90% large septal branch lesion, and a 65-70% proximal PDA stenosis.  Ventriculogram revealed an EF of 35-40%.  He underwent stenting to the PDA lesion on 03/06/2161.  An exercise Myoview performed in 01/2160 revealed no evidence of inducible ischemia.

2.  Hypertension.

3.  Dyslipidemia.

4.  Diabetes.

5.  Obstructive sleep apnea.

6.  COPD, prescribed home oxygen, though he is not taking this.

7.  Carotid disease, status post left CEA after presenting with an ipsilateral episode of amaurosis fugax.

8.? History of BLANK AAA by ultrasound in 07/2159.

9.  Atrial fibrillation.

10.  Obesity.



He has no known drug allergies.



His current medications include amiodarone 200 mg BLANK, but this has been discontinued since April, metoprolol 50 mg b.i.d., digoxin 0.25 mg daily, Zocor 20 mg daily, Plavix 75 mg daily, TriCor 145 mg daily, Lasix 20 mg daily, BLANK 5 mg nightly, aspirin 325 mg daily, Lantus insulin 62 units daily, Humalog insulin, and Protonix 40 mg daily.



His social history is notable for remote history of tobacco dependence.  He was formally employed in buidling construction.  He has multiple environmental exposures including insulation as well as spray paint and without respiratory protection.  He does not currently smoke or drink alcohol.



His family history is negative for early onset CAD, sudden cardiac death, or cardiomyopathy.  His father lived until the age of 88.  His mother died of a stroke at the age of 80.  He has a single sister who is 86 years of age and has no history of heart troubles.



Physical Examination:  His blood pressure is 115/60 BLANK of 66 beats per minute.  In general, he is overweight elderly man in no distress.  Sitting upright his jugular venous pressure is below the clavicles.  Carotid upstrokes are brisk bilaterally.  Lungs are notable for a few crackles at the bases, but otherwise clear.  There is no wheezing.  Cardiac exam reveals an irregular rate with a variable S1 and S2.  There is no audible murmur, rub or gallop.  Abdomen is obese, soft, and nontender.  Lower extremities are warm and well perfused.  There is trace pitting edema at the ankles.



Recent blood work reveals an INR of 2.2 on 05/28/2161.



EKG today reveals atrial fibrillation at a rate of approximately 66 beats per minute.  There are some nonspecific T-wave abnormalities, but otherwise no evidence of prior infarct or ST changes.  There is some low voltage in the limb leads, though I suspect this is related to his habitus.



Overall, Mr. Dejesus is a pleasant 78-year-old man with a complex prior medical history who appears to have persistent atrial fibrillation with a principal functional limitation of exertional shortness of breath.  He appears to be functional class III.  He does not have any frank evidence of volume overload on exam today, though his ventricular function and is not entirely normal.  Moreover, he has multiple comorbidities which may exacerbate his exertional dyspnea including COPD and coronary artery disease.



We discussed atrial fibrillation with Mr. Dejesus and his family today.  We explained that the brief period of normal sinus rhythm associated with symptomatic improvement may be a reason to proceed with catheter ablation.  However, given his comorbidities and the presence of persistent arrhythmia we warned that a single catheter ablation procedure may not be entirely successful and that waiting period of approximately 3-4 month post-ablation may be required to adjudicate success.  Given the length of the procedure as well as his comorbidities, we feel reasonable to consult with our anesthesia colleagues for possible consideration of performing the procedure under general anesthesia versus with MAC and had procedural sedation.  We will leave this decision to them.  Moreover, prior to the ablation, we will request a transesophageal echocardiogram to rule out left atrial clot prior to ablation.



Thank you very much for referring Mr. Dejesus to our care.  We will be in touch following the procedure.  As always, feel free to call with any questions.



Sincerely,

EDVISIT^56040785^OROZCO, KYLE^02/14/90^CHANEY, QUENTIN
CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Chest pain.

I confirm that I have interviewed and examined the patient,

reviewed the resident's documentation on the patient's chart, and

discussed the evaluation, plan of care, and disposition with the

patient.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  In essence, this is a pleasant

65-year-old male with known history of CAD who presents

complaining of some chest discomfort that began tonight while

walking, took 2 nitro and the pain got better.  Then, had a

repeat episode relived by nitro again.  Picked up by EMS.  Given

aspirin as well.  He describes the pain as 8/10, sharp, left

sided, substernal, and deep.  No diaphoresis, no nausea, no

vomiting, and some shortness of breath associated with it.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension, diabetes, CAD, and

peripheral vascular disease.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He is a past smoker, occasional drinker.  Lives

with family.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Angioplasty with multiple stents and an

A-fem bypass in 2074.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Per HPI.

ALLERGIES:  Does not have any allergies.

MEDICATIONS:  He is on multiple medications which include Plavix,

Zocor, aspirin, Norvasc, enalapril, NovoLog, Lasix, Neurontin,

and Lantus.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Pulse of 90, respirations 16, blood

pressure 186/56, oxygen saturation 97%, and temperature is 97.4.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient has a
new apartment.  She is actually in the process of moving. 
She recognizes that she is improving, and is very excited
about the fact that, during the course of the week, she went
out to Sel de la Terre, and also went through a movie with her
friend.  

Her sugars are still not well controlled.  She has been
liberalizing her diet, which I thought was appropriate.  I
did increase her morning insulin to 20 units of 30/70, and
suggested that she change from five units of NPH at bedtime
to 8 units of 30-70, taken with her supper, to try to give
her a little better coverage for her evening meal.  I wrote
a note to the nurse to actuate this change.  They actually
called me later in the evening, on page, and I discussed
this with them, at length, at that time, including the
rationale for this change.

She is not having any exertional or other chest pain.  No
orthopnea, PND or peripheral edema.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Blood pressure is 135/80.  Heart rate
68 and regular.  Respirations 14.  Venous pressure 3.  Clear
chest.  S4, no S3.  No retrosternal dullness or rub.  She
has only a trace of ankle edema.

IMPRESSION AND PLAN:  Her verbal skills have improved.  She
got very nervous when I tried to test her cognitive skills,
and was able to give me the days of the week forward, but
not backwards.  I did not push her beyond that.  I did tell
her that we would need to check her TSH in a couple weeks'
time, to see if last increment had returned her to a
euthyroid state.

? SCCA of nose.  Derm referral.

L carotid bruit.  Given known cerebrovascular disease needs NICS 

Cardiac.  Obtain old records from cardiologist.  Recent ECHO and stress evals.

Voiding dysfunction.  Check psa.  Likely BPH but could relate in part to cognitive issues.  Begin alpha blocker as he needs better BP control as well.

Rheumatology Consult Note

Name: Mullins, Dolores U
MRN: 72841920
DOB: 06/06/02
Location: 78Q-47-4
Consult date: 09/01/79
Referring Physician: Gay Langley
Source of history: patient interview, medical records
Code status: Full

Reason for Consult: bilateral LE pain up to knees
HPI:
77 yo F w/h/o type I DM and HTN.  At the beginning of this year, she began to have intermittent    burning    pain of her feet and sometimes her lower legs/feet.  This pain typically occurred on one leg more than the other, without an overall predominance of one side.  In the past month, she has had continuous, bilateral    burning    pain that began in both feet.  Several weeks ago, her pain worsened considerably such that she was having difficulty shopping.  Around this time, the pain spread up her legs to above her knees.  She also noted having difficulty putting on shoes and was told by a friend that her feet were swollen (she is unable to see her feet due to blindness).  Her pain continued to worsen until the night prior to admission, when she was in her bathroom and found herself in such pain that she was unable to get up to leave the bathroom.  A friend found her after 8 hours and EMS was called.  In the ED, she was found to have BP elevated to 190, Cr elevated to 2.8, FSG down to 51, and R-sided hydronephrosis.  Labetolol/diltiazem were given for HTN with good response, IV hydration was given with subsequent decline in Cr, and Foley was placed with resolution of hydronephrosis on subsequent MRI.   

She has never had    burning    pain of the kind that she presented with prior to this year.  Of note, she has had    years    of tingling without numbness in her lower extremities bilaterally extending to above her knees.  She also notes numbness of the tips of her R 2nd-4th digits.  ROS positive for subjective decline in urine output and constipation (1 BM/2days).  She denies fever/chills/sweats, recent weight loss, fatigue, hypoglycemic episodes, cough/rhinorrhea/sore throat, SOB, orthpnea, CP, palpitations, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dysuria, polyuria/polydipsia.

A/P: 77 yo F w/h/o DM and HTN who presented with several weeks of worsening bilateral LE burning pain exacerbated by movement and pressure.  She was found to have exquisitely tender joints up to and including her knees with visible synovial effusions of her knees bilaterally.  Aspiration of one of her knees revealed needle-shaped negatively birefringent crystals, diagnostic of gout.  This is consistent with her elevated uric acid and her elevated markers of inflammation (ESR/CRP).  Given that she has a long history of symptoms of LE diabetic neuropathy and that she has some diffuse soft tissue tenderness, she may also have some pain from diabetic neuropathy that may declare itself after her gout is treated.  However, her current inability to walk can be clearly attributed to gout.  

Recs:
- Solumedrol 40 mg bid IV, prednisone 40 mg qd starting tomorrow with 12-day outpatient taper (40 mg x 3 days, 30 mg x 3 days, 20 mg x 3 days, 10 mg x 3 days)
- Colchicine po 0.6 mg qd for 2 weeks, then 0.6 mg qod for 2 weeks
- Continue to hold HCTZ     discuss with PCP need to restart as outpatient as it is a risk factor for hyperuricemia
- F/u with rheumatology in 4 weeks for initiation of allopurinol (please arrange appointment w/ Dr. Yau)



Procedure: R knee aspiration
Patient was informed of the risks of bleeding and infection and gave consent. The medial aspect of the right knee was sterilized using iodine swabs x3, sterile gloves used in a one-handed sterile lateral approach. 1.5cc of 1% lidocaine was injected to raise a wheal inferior to the R patella. A 18G needle was inserted into the knee and approximately 20cc of opaque, yellow fluid was withdrawn. A slide was prepared and examined under the microscope by myself, Dr. Yau, and Dr. Woodard.  Abundant intracellular and extracellular needle-shapped negatively birefringent crystals were observed.  Synovial fluid sample was also submitted for culture, Gram stain, cell count, and crystal analysis.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Dyspnea on exertion.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. Ware is a 67-year-old man with

a history of diabetes and myelodysplastic syndrome, status post

stem cell transplant who presents to the Emergency Department

with a 2 to 3 week history of increasing exertional dyspnea.  The

patient denies chest pain, palpitations, or syncope but does

complain of bilateral lower extremity edema times several weeks. 

The patient has been worked up for the symptoms as an outpatient

and placed on Lasix for the past 2 weeks and had an

echocardiogram today, which was remarkable for atrial

fibrillation.  The patient was sent to the Emergency Department

for further evaluation.  Please see the written record for

further details.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Insulin-dependent diabetes,

myelodysplastic syndrome, status post stem cell transplant.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Basal cell resection.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient denies smoking, alcohol, or illicit

drug use.

MEDICATIONS:  Lasix, vitamin D, Lantus, and acyclovir.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  I have examined the patient and agree with

the physical as documented.  Of note, the patient is awake and

alert, in no acute distress.  Vitals:  Temperature is 96.9, pulse

is 100 to 128, respiratory rate of 18, blood pressure is 118/70,

and oxygen saturation is 96%.  Lungs:  Clear bilaterally with no

rales, rhonchi, or wheezing.  Cardiovascular exam:  Irregularly

irregular rhythm.  Normal S1 and S2.  No murmurs.  Abdomen:  Soft

with no tenderness, guarding, or rebound.  Extremity exam:  The

patient has bilateral lower extremity 2+ pitting edema, left

greater than right.  No calf tenderness.

MEDICAL DECISION MAKING AND EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  Mr.

Ware is a 67-year-old man with diabetes and a 2-week history of

increasing dyspnea on exertion.  His chest x-ray did not

demonstrate pulmonary edema, but was significant for bilateral

pleural effusions.  The patient's EKG demonstrated a flutter with

a ventricular rate of 121 with inferolateral T-wave inversions. 

The patient was given IV and p.o. Cardizem with control of the

ventricular rate.  At the time of this dictation, the patient's

laboratory data are not available.  The plan is to admit the

patient to the hospital for further management.

PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS:  New onset AFib.

DISPOSITION:  Admission.

CONDITION UPON ADMISSION:  Good.

DODD,STEVEN   350-93-05-3                      VISIT DATE: 09/28/79

The patient was interviewed and examined by me as well as by the 

resident.

HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  In brief, this is a 64-year-old 

gentleman with morbid obesity.  He is on CPAP.  He has CHF, 

hypertension, chronic renal insufficiency, triple bypass, and 

diabetes.  He had three episodes of chest pain which woke him up 

from CPAP last last night.  Each episode reminded him of his 

typical angina, but the last time he had it was in May.  Those 

three episodes were resolved with one sublingual nitroglycerin.  He 

woke up today and thought he needed to be evaluated.  He is also 

complaining of low grade temperature.  He has recently been 

receiving VNA services as a result of a left foot ulcer as a result 

of an oxygen tank burn.  His VNA came to visit him today and found 

that he had some crackles in his lungs with a temperature and was 

concerned about a pneumonia.  Please see the resident's note for 

details. 

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  He denies chest pain now.  No shortness of 

breath now.  He states that his foot appears to be getting better.

MEDICATIONS:  Atenolol, aspirin, isosorbide, Lasix, Glyburide, 

Lipitor, and Lorazepam.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies. 

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  GENERAL APPEARANCE:  The patient is a 

morbidly obese gentleman.  VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 100.2, pulse 

62, respiratory rate 18, blood pressure 173/74.  O2 saturation is 

99%.  LUNGS:  He has rales at the right base.  Unable to assess 

JVD.  ABDOMEN:  He is obese with active bowel sounds.  EXTREMITIES: 

Distal left foot lateral ulcer is dry, necrotic, without 

surrounding edema or tenderness.

LABORATORY EVALUATION:  His white count here is 14.  His BUN and 

creatinine are 25 and 2.4, which is his baseline.  CK is 28, 

troponin pending.  INR is 1.2.  EKG shows no changes from prior.  

Chest x-ray shows right pleural effusion with question right 

paratracheal mass.

CONSULTATIONS (including PCP):  His care was discussed with the 

Christus Spohn cardiology.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  Unstable angina pectoris.

DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  He is going to 

be treated with antibiotics, aspirin, Lopressor, and admitted to 

the hospital for a rule out.  Condition on admission is stable.  He 

will be presumptively treated for a pneumonia on the right side.

Re:  Jennifer Vance

     MR#  542-66-00-3

 

Dear Wanda:

 

Mrs. Vance returns for routine follow up.  At the present time,

she continues to complain of exertional angina,  and states that

she is willing to consider undergoing cardiac catheterization.  As

you know, I had suggested this to her last November.  

 

She continues now on a regimen of Atenolol 25 mg p.o. q.d., Paxil

20 mg p.o. q.d., Humalog 10 units sub.q. q.a.m., NPH 25 units

sub.q. q.a.m., sliding scale CZI throughout the day, isosorbide

mononitrate 60 mg p.o. q.d., Pravastatin 20 mg p.o. q.d., Flonase,

Neurontin 300 mg p.o. b.i.d., and Celexa.

 

Physical exam reveals a thin woman in no acute distress.  Blood

pressure right arm sitting 92/60, heart rate 75 and regular.  

Respirations 12 and unlabored.  Weight 109 pounds.  This is one

pound above her weight of six months ago.  The neck is supple. JVP 

is flat.  Carotids  with continuing right greater than left bruits. 

Chest is clear.  Cardiac exam reveals a normal, physiologically

split S2, and a soft systolic ejection murmur radiating from the

apex to the base.  No significant diastolic murmur.  The abdomen is

benign.  Extremities are without edema.   The pulses are intact. 

 

Electrocardiogram shows a sinus rhythm at a rate of 75, PR interval

.12, QRS .08, QT .34, axis 75 degrees.  There are lateral ST and T

wave changes compatible with strain or ischemia.  Compared to her

last electrocardiogram, there has been no significant change.

 

Impression:  Ms. Vance is a 48-year-old woman with a history of

variegata porphyria, insulin dependent diabetes, and significant

graft to her LAD, after developing restenosis at the site of a

balloon LAD angioplasty.  The results of the catheterization will

determine subsequent therapeutic recommendations.  She will have

her insulin dose on the morning of her scheduled catheterization.

 

Thank you very much for allowing me to assist in her care.

He presented to the Sheffield Center ED, and shortly after he was seen his left sided weakness resolved, although his visual field deficits and right hand paresthesia as well as his headache had remained. He denies F/C/N/V. No neck stiffness. 



He had a noncontrast head CT which was negative for any acute process per radiology read.  He had an LP with 2 WBC, 2 RBC, glucose 98, protein 84, appeared clear. Gram stain with no orgs, rare polys.  ESR 44, crypto ag pending.  He was transferred to HSH because Sheffield Center does not have an MRI machine.



He says that his pulmonary status has been stable, and produces a moderate amount of yellow sputum. He does not do chest PT at home. He has a h/o mild sinusitis, but he says that it hasn't been bothering him lately. He has been having normal bowel movements with no difficulties with constipation.

Recommendations: 

1.	Neuro: Would get a brain MRI/MRA to further evaluate.  After the MRI is done, would get a neurology consult in the morning.  Continue ASA, BP control in the meantime.  Patient may need a repeat LP depending on neuro consult recs.

2.	Pulm: CF appears stable. Would continue his outpatient Advair, albuterol, azithro.

3.	GI: continue enzymes, vitamins. High calorie, high protein CF diet.

4.	Endo: monitor blood glucose.

Lung Transplant Attending Note:



I have seen and examined the patient with Dr. Titus and I agree with her evaluation and plan as outlined above.  Mr. Aguilar is a 48 yo man with h/o CF with mild pulmonary disease, who presented to an OSH on 1/26 with sudden onset of right upper ext paresthesias, followed by a loss of left visual field, diplopia, and left sided weakness.  The patient denies incontinence but had some gait instability related to weakness.  The patient was evaluated at the OSH with non-contrast head CT and L/P which were significant only for elevated CSF protein.  Currently symptoms have resolved other than persistent occipital headache which began with the onset of the other symptoms, as well as unilateral hemianopsia in the left eye evident on exam.  Exam also notable for disdiadochokinesis, otherwise neurologic exam non-focal.  Lung exam notable for diminished BS but no wheezes or crackles.  DDX for above includes ischemic process, though symptoms appear to be multi-focal, vs. mononeuritis multiplex related to inflammatory process.  Less likely is mass lesion leading to above symptoms, or meningeal process.  We plan to obtain CNS MRI, neuro consult.  Will await MRI findings prior to pursuing further serologic work-up.  Continue maintenance medications for CF.

Mitchell, Katie 

MR# 6146161

Date of Admission: July 24, 2091

Date of Transfer: Jul 28, 2091

Pulm:  Geoffrey Lucas

PCP:  Evelyn Conway (Raymond)

Cards:  Janssen



ID/CC: SOB



HPI:   Ms. Mitchell is a 75 yo woman w/ a PMH notable for COPD w/ FEV1/FVC=63%, HOCM s/p MVR and septal myomectomy in 2085 who presents with increasing SOB and DOE for the past 4 days.  Of note, her and her son note increasing DOE for the past 4 months and she was scheduled for outpatient TTE today.  She also reports DOE and productive cough with green- yellow sputum that has been blood tinged ever since her EGD on 7/10/91.  She also notes recent URI symptoms especially runny nose as well as diarrhea the day PTA with 6 loose BMs.  On the day prior to admission, she had drenching sweats but didn't take her temperature.  She has also had decreased po intake (though improved w/ treatment for her trigeminal neuralgia) but denies F/C/CP/abd pain/dysuria.  Her symptoms acutely worsened today such that she was in acute respiratory distress and EMS was called..	

	EMS was called and the patient was noted to initially be speaking in full sentences but became more acutely SOB in the ambulance.  In the ED, she was afebrile but tachycardic to 120 and hypertensive at 180/80.  She initially required bipap with O2 sats of 93%.  She was given prednisone, Levaquin and nebulizers with mild improvement in her symptoms.  Of note, she was also noted to have mild ST changes on her EKG while she was tachycardic to the 120s.  She received ASA, Lopressor and Ativan and cardiac enzymes showed an elevated CK and CK-MB but negative troponin at 0.03.  Her EKG improved with rate control w/ IV Lopressor.  She was also given 30mg IV Lasix given some mild LE edema to which she put out 200cc urine.  She is now admitted to the floor for further management of her SOB.



ROS:   No F/C, + NS.  Improving appetite. No CP/Palpitations/Orthopnea/PND/Claudication, + LE edema for the past 1-2 months.  No N/V/D/hematochezia/melena. No delta MS/LOC. No slurring of speech, unilateral weakness. No dysuria.



Hospital Course: Patient had TTE performed on 7/24/91 which showed increase trans-mitral valve gradient. Given patient's history of MVR, TEE was recommended. On the night of 7/24/91, patient (who was known to sundown) tried to attack her roommate and fell on the floor hitting her head. No change in MS. In the setting of being on coumadin, patient had a stat CT of the head done which was negative for bleeds. On 7/25/91, patient went down for a TEE but desated to 80s and the procedure was aborted. Dr. Janssen then decided to perform cardiac cath on the patient Saturday 7/28/91. On 7/26/91, decision was made to put her on BIPAP for the night, and the patient did well and felt rested the next morning. On 7/27/91, because patient looked so well, she was not put on BIPAP but rather only on O2NC for the night. This AM, patient's respiratory status declined satting in the low 90s while on O2 6LNC. ABG was performed which showed 7.48/52/50. After speaking to cardiology, decision was made to transfer the patient to the CCU for intubation prior to cardiac cath this PM. A TEE will be performed while patient is intubated. Patient is currently NPO ready for cath this PM.



PMH:

1.	COPD- PFTs on 7/17/91 w/ FEV1=32%, FEV1/FVC=63%

2.	MVR- St. Jude's valve, 2085

CT angiogram- Negative for PE on preliminary read

CXR:	Small bilateral pleural effusions



EKG:	Sinus tachycardia at 112bpm, LAE, 1mm ST depressions V4-V6 (similar when compared to previous EKG w/ tachycardia to 120) 



TTE: Compared to the report of 09/09/2090, the transmitral gradients have increased, the degree of MR and AI has increased, and the RV systolic pressure has increased significantly. LV size and function remain normal. If clinically indicated, a transesophageal echo is suggested to better evaluate the prosthetic valve.



CTHead:

	1.  NO ACUTE INTRACRANIAL HEMORRHAGE OR FRACTURE.

	2.  NON-SPECIFIC PERIVENTRICULAR AND SUBCORTICAL WHITE MATTER

	HYPOATTENUATING AREAS ARE LIKELY DUE TO CHRONIC MICROANGIOPATHIC

	CHANGES.



___________________________________________

Impression:

Ms. Mitchell is a 75 yo woman w/ multiple medical problems including HOCM, s/p MVR and myomectomy as well as COPD who presents with increasing SOB and DOE for the past four days.  Of note, the patient notes increasing DOE for the past 4 months but with acute decompensation today.  Her progressive DOE may be related to CHF, especially in the setting of ischemic changes seen on EKG however, her acute decompensation may be related to COPD exacerbation in the setting of a viral illness.



Plan: 

SOB- Unclear etiology currently by may likely be multifactorial

--Treat COPD w/ Atrovent nebs, prednisone, O2, Levaquin

--Patient did not tolerate tachycardiac so Albuterol was DC'ed

--Follow urine output secondary to IV Lasix

--Daily weights, strict Is and Os

--Keep O2 sats 88-90% 

EKG changes- Pt w/o known history of CAD however w/ and ST depressions on EKG that appear rate related

--IV Lopressor to decrease rate

--ASA

--Cardiac monitor

--Cardiac cath per Dr. Janssen with TEE

MVR- On Coumadin

--Follow INR

Trigeminal neuralgia- Improving w/ pain control and Tegretol

--Continue current management

FEN- 

--Encourage Pos

--Replete lytes as needed

6.    Prophylaxis- Nexium, Coumadin

Patient comes in today for follow-up of recent hospitalization for L1 fracture following a fall. She was in her usual state of health until 2 months ago when she suffered a mechanical fall while visiting family in South Korea. She sustained an L1 fracture without surgical intervention, and returned to canada where she presented to the ED on 3/9/76 wiht back pain, L1 planar fracture with evidence of minimal cord compressionl She was admitted and seen by neurosurgery who felt that there was no acute indication for surgery. Since then, she has had continued pain in her back with occasional burning in her feet but no numbness or tingling. She would like to undergo surgery at this point because her pain is intolerable. She is in contact with a neurosurgeon at this time regarding when to proceed with surgery.



She is otherwise doing well. ROS positive for chest tightness with walking one block with some feeling of being ""winded."" She does not have this feeling at rest, and states it has been ongoing for the past year. She describes some peripheral edema, as well as PND.

70-year-old female, first visit to MSH AMED. 



MEDICATIONS:  Ibuprofen 800 mg 1 p.o. b.i.d., has taken for years. Self-d/c'd meclizine, unclear status on H2 blocker.



ALLERGIES: Percocet, codeine, sulfa.



PMH: Includes fibromyalgia with chronic pain, osteoarthritis, recurrent vertigo, cervical spondylosis, lumbar spondylosis, carpal tunnel syndrome, myofascial pain, dizziness, syncope, chest pain of unclear etiology, sinusitis, DJD. Status post laminectomy 2062. 



S:	70-year-old female accompanied by daughter, Qazi, here to initiate primary care closer to home. Previously followed by Dr. Faust, but daughter needs closer PCP. In addition, patient followed in arthritis clinic by Dr. Solomon and has received injections per patient report from severe muscle spasms of both arms. Also seen by pain clinic. Main issue is continued lower back pain and primary care. Of concern is patient reveals an unclear history of chest pain which was thought to be arthritis, but is accompanied by episodes of syncope, witnessed in a grocery store. Patient has not had to her knowledge a cardiac workup for this. Also had some vascular studies done at that time and was told they were normal. The patient is unclear on status of recent pelvic exam. GYN - G7, P7, still with uterus but not sexually active. Denies any change in bowels. Denies any change in appetite. 



The patient has been complaining of animals crawling across her chest. States she used a cream for 1 week with resolution but now feels the animals are back, and she has been using a pesticide agent which sounds like a Kwell agent to resolve these. 



Recent testing - L-spine films confirm grade 2 anterospondylolisthesis L4-L5 with disc space changes at L1-L2. Negative allergy testing. 1/1 immune globulin testing significant for an IgG of 15/40 and positive ANA at 1:40 and 1:60. MRI of spine 12/93 shows degenerative changes of lumbar spine. No evidence of disc herniation or canal stenosis. 11/92 - Paranasal sinus films show no evidence of sinusitis. Mammo 3/94 WNL. Carotid ultrasound done 12/93 shows minimal disease of right and left carotid bifurcations. TCDs 12/93 suggest a stenosis of the left vertebral artery with an RVA WNL. Velocity suggests a mild stenosis. EKG 12/93 shows sinus brad with an LAE. No other significant changes. Nonspecific ST changes. 



O:	HEENT - Unremarkable. Skin - No obvious sign of rash or infection where she states the animals are present. CV - BP is 170/88. RR at 60. No murmurs, gallops, rubs present. Lungs - Clear to P&A. B12 was 331. Attempted Pap smear. External genitalia unremarkable. Vaginal introitus is very small. Patient got very cold and clammy and nervous throughout the tried Pap smear; so Pap smear attempt was terminated at that time. Consent was obtained to conduct Pap smear. Lungs - Clear to P&A. 



A/P:	(1)	Dizziness of unclear etiology. Neuro consult had been done when the patient was hospitalized, and meclizine has not been of any benefit. Will refer patient to Vascular to ascertain whether the TCD findings are related. 



(2)	Report of syncope. Will obtain stress test.



(3)	Chronic NSAID usage. Add ranitidine HCL 150 mg to 1 p.o. q.h.s. to regime. Patient will follow up with Dr. Helen Whitehead as  her new PCP.

with history of prior stroke, hypertension, diabetes, and

paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, who presents with altered mental

status and urinary incontinence.  Differential diagnosis at this

time includes infectious versus a metabolic abnormality.  The

patient has no new deficits on neuro exam as per the family and

as per review of prior notes.  Repeat stroke is certainly on the

differential, however, I have a lower suspicion then for a

metabolic or infectious etiology.  The patient will need to have

a large workup including laboratory studies, urine studies, Foley

catheter, portable chest x-ray, and repeat noncontrast head CT

scan.

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  Upon arrival to the Emergency

Department, the patient had history and physical exam performed. 

The patient was noted to be in atrial fibrillation with rapid

ventricular response.  The patient's 12-lead EKG revealed a rate

of 166 beats per minute, atrial fibrillation with rapid

ventricular response, stable T-wave inversions noted over the

lateral leads as well as over the precordial leads.  No definite

ST segment abnormalities were noted.  The patient then had a

portable chest x-ray and as per report, the patient's portable

chest x-ray did not reveal any acute cardiopulmonary process or

findings.  The patient did have a noncontrast head CT scan and

the patient's noncontrast head CT scan was notable for some

right-sided edema.  The patient will have this followed up with

an MRI of the brain.  The patient's laboratory studies were

notable for sodium of 131 and potassium of 5.2.  The patient's

lactic acid was 1.7.  The patient's white blood cell count was

not elevated.  The patient was not anemic.  The patient's

urinalysis was consistent with infection.  The patient's first

set of cardiac markers were negative.  The patient's coagulation

studies were normal.  The patient was treated with ceftriaxone

for her urinary tract infection.  The patient could possibly have

urosepsis given her fever and tachycardia.  Urine sepsis is my

leading diagnosis at this time.  The patient's right-sided edema

is certainly concerning, however, I do not feel that the patient

will need to be admitted to Neurology at this time.  The patient

will be admitted to medicine for presumed urosepsis.  The patient

will need to be admitted to a monitor bed.  The patient's blood

pressure is normal, and as such, I do not feel that the patient

needs an intensive care unit bed.  In terms the patient's atrial

fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, the patient was

given metoprolol IV.  The patient was not given any oral

medications secondary to her possible stroke.  The patient was

given rectal Tylenol as well as rectal Kayexalate for her

elevated potassium at 5.2.

PRIMARY DIAGNOSES:

1.  Urosepsis.

2.  Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.

3.  Hyponatremia.

4.  Hyperkalemia.

DISPOSITION:  The patient was admitted to the Medicine and to a

monitor bed.

CONDITION AT THE TIME OF DISPOSITION:  Stable, but guarded.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Hypertension, proteinuria, status post fall,
reevaluate Coumadin.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Urgent care visit for this
77-year-old woman with the history of diabetes, multiple strokes,
hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and multiple other issues.  Last
week she was at Saint Joseph Memorial Hospital for an eye evaluation.
 It was a very very windy day.  Afterwards she was outside and a
huge gust of wind knocked her over.  Her daughter Fitzpatrick was with
her and Fitzpatrick herself actually had to hold on to something when
the wind blew.  There is no chest pain or presyncope, and no loss
of consciousness either before, during, or after the episode. 
She struck her left trochanteric area, left deltoid area, and
left eyebrow.  She was taken to EFH where she had a normal head
CT.  A single stitch was placed in the laceration along the
lateral edge of her left eyebrow.  She had films of her wrist and
hips both of which were fine.  She has bruising in these areas. 
Other than some pain where the bruising is she feels entirely
back to normal.

She had marked hypertension up to 250.  She was treated with
hydralazine in the ER, and was noted to have proteinuria with
some hematuria.  Her blood pressure at home since then has been
180 and 210 systolic on her usual 40 mg daily of lisinopril.  She
is not on a beta-blocker currently.  She has not had any episodes
of chest pain.  She does feel slightly more woozy than usual.

MEDICATIONS:  Metformin 500 mg p.o. b.i.d., Prevacid 30 mg p.o.
q.d., atorvastatin 10 mg q.d., sertraline 50 mg q.d., warfarin,
lisinopril 40 mg q.d., Ambien 10 mg q.h.s. p.r.n., levothyroxine
100 mg p.o. q.d., aspirin, eyedrops, Colace, and Dulcolax.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She is looking forward to a good Christmas. 
She is here today with her daughter Fitzpatrick.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 97.2, pulse 74, BP 208/66,
weight 148 pounds.
GENERAL: Well appearing woman.
HEENT: PERRL.  Single stitch along the lateral aspect of her left
eyebrow is easily removed.  No evidence of any infection.  Her
left deltoid area is fine and she has good range of motion in the
shoulder.  Her left ribcage is slightly tender but without any
bony step-offs.  She walks well with no pain in her left hip. 
There is a hand sized deep purple bruise over the trochanteric
bursa.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  Mechanical fall with laceration and
bruising but no more serious complications.  Fortunately she did
not have intracranial bleeding.  I am not sure why her blood
pressure is up, whether this is related to the stress of the
falls verses independent causes.  Given that the high blood
pressure has persisted, I will add atenolol 12.5 mg p.o. q.d.,
and discuss via phone or E-mail with her daughter next week to
see how well this is working.  Goal BP 140-160 systolic.  Her
urine was checked today.  Hematuria has resolved.  She has 2+
proteinuria.  I will recheck this in a week or two after we treat
her hypertension.

We spent over half of today's 45-minute visit discussing risks
and benefits of Coumadin therapy.  Although she is at risk for
falls, she feels quite clearly that she prefers to be on the
Coumadin due to her fear of having a repeated thrombotic stroke. 
She feels that she has not had any bleeding complications, and
that she really would not like to suffer through another stroke. 
I explained that there was some risk with falls of intracranial
hemorrhage and its consequences.  I spoke with Dr. Dewitt last
month about her Coumadin, and we both feel that it seems to be
working well in terms of stroke prevention, but that she is at
increased risk for falls.  It seems to me that she is in a gray
area with no clear right answer in terms of risk benefit analysis
for Coumadin for her.  She feels very strongly that she wishes to
continue.  This was discussed in detail with her and her
daughter, and this probably is a reasonable decision.  I
encouraged her to restart physical therapy to work on her
strength and hopefully diminish her risk of a subsequent fall. 
More than half of today's 45-minute visit spent in patient
counseling and education.

Patient Name: 	Ethridge, Clayton

Medical Record #: 	8381729

Date of Admission: 	01/08/64
Attending: 		Dr. Burton



CC/ID:	clotted AV fistula / renal failure



HPI: 	The patient is a 55 year old male with a past medical history significant for chronic renal failure (secondary to diabetes & hypertension) and gastrointestinal mucormycosis who underwent an arteriovenous graft placement ten days prior to admission. The patient was doing well until a few days prior to admission when he noticed a swelling in his new graft and a decrease in the degree of its pulse. Then on the morning of admission when he noticed his graft was without a palpable pulse or thrill. The patient then presented to the EDUCARE-PULLMAN ER for evaluation and treatment. 



	In the ER, the patient was found to have an engorged AV graft without dopplerable pulse or bruit. The patient was seen by surgery and an ultrasound of the upper extremity revealed a clotted graft and so the patient was admitted to the medical service for further evaluation and treatment.



Of note, the patient denies any pain  / numbness / coolness in his hand. He further denies any shortness of breath, increased swelling in his legs, or changes in his weight. He does indicate that he has suffered from decreased oral intake lately secondary to feeling tired and having a decreased appetite.

Major Problems





Diabetes mellitus

His current blood sugar readings are fasting 95-131 but 2 hrs after meals in the afternoon and evening have ranges from 159-276. he says his diet has been reasonable with a few exceptions when he has cheated and his blood sugar did reflect what he ate. I believe it`s time to change him to Lantus for better coverage. 

P I will change his NPH to Lantus 10units at bedtime he will continue testing at least twice a day and he says he is going to test at least 4x`s a day for a while. he is still on glucotrol which we may need to discontinue as not to increase his hypoglcemic episodes. I will mail him scripts to fill at his request and call him to review blood sugars and need for titration in about 2 weeks to give him enough time to be on the insulin for at least 1 week. 7/15/84 Home BS quite good! Low 100s 9/12/84.....In general, he has been failing at home, unable to care for himself, and requiring increasing VNA.

HPI: 	The patient is a 55 year old male with a past medical history significant for chronic renal failure (secondary to diabetes & hypertension) and gastrointestinal mucormycosis who was recently admitted for a clotted AVF, s/p thrombectomy. Unfortunately, graft eventually reclotted and was deemed unsalvageable- the patient was then started on HD via a tunnelled catheter. Was tolerating this well, until day prior to admission noted a fever prior to going to HD. Blood cultures taken yesterday at HD, returned today with GPC in clusters, further speciation to follow. Admitted for fever workup.

Pt. currently complains of some generalized fatigue, malaise, nausea. Has a hx of abdominal mucormycosis resulting in chronic abdominal discomfort, which today is at baseline. No CP, SOB.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Multiple acute and chronic medical issues,
including subacute weight loss. 

IDENTIFICATION:  This is my first medical visit with this
75-year-old woman with multiple recent hospitalizations.  

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  She has a long history of
severe cerebrovascular disease, with multiple strokes.  She
has stenosis in both anterior and posterior circulation. 
Past right carotid endarterectomy.  

In August 2095, she was admitted to BMH with a right
cerebellar stroke, complicated by a brief intubation and
pneumonia.  She underwent stenting of her right vertebral
artery and left common carotid artery.  She had subsequent
episodes of worsening speech, and was started on Coumadin,
with an INR goal of 2.5 to 3.0.  She is followed closely by
Neurology and may, at some point, undergo further
interventional radiology procedures, to be determined.  

During her most recent hospitalization she had some
confusion which was attributed to low sodium.  This was
felt to be the result of osmotic diuresis, and possible
SIADH.  This is being treated with salt tablets, saline
boluses in her G-tube, water restriction, and low-dose
Lasix.  No evidence of adrenal insufficiency.  

Since leaving the hospital, she has had ongoing weight loss.
 Baseline weight 170 pounds.  Weight in early September, 167
pounds.  Weight October 20th, 160 pounds.  Weight November 

28th, 141 pounds.  Weight today in clinic 146 pounds on our scale.  

She had a swallowing study on October 26, 2095, which
revealed no aspiration, but very poor bolus formation.  The
G-tube was placed in August, and has healed well, but has
never been used for daily tube feeds on an outpatient basis.
 Over the past couple of weeks, she has worsening trouble
with coughing, choking and sputtering, as she attempts to
swallow.  Her caloric p.o. intake sounds as if it has been
quite minimal, with a couple of ounces of potatoes or pureed
foods here and there.  She is drinking two or three can of
booster Ensure daily, but clearly not meeting her caloric
needs.  Today's visit was with the patient, and her daughter
(phone number 507.741.8042).  

Most recent laboratory studies, done 12/7/2095: Sodium 137,
potassium 4.8, chloride 95, Bicarb 32, BUN 22, creatinine
1.0, calcium 9.9, glucose 162.  

The patient has felt increasingly weak and debilitated, as
her weight has decreased.  

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Also remarkable for slight bright red
blood per rectum within the last week.  The patient's
daughter describes that she had a normal colonoscopy in
early 2095, at the Richwood Area Community Hospital.  The
patient's daughter will bring me these records at the next
visit. 

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Cerebrovascular disease, as noted above. 
2. Throat cancer in early 2060s.  Status post XRT to the
neck (may have predisposed her to the severe carotid and
vertebral disease).
3. Breast cancer.  Details unknown.  Will review at next
visit. 
4. Diabetes, type II.  On glyburide.  Further details
unknown. 
5. SIADH.  Will review hospital chart in detail. 
6. Hypertension.  Per Neurology, goal blood pressure 140 to
170.  
7. Hypothyroidism.  Details unknown.  Recent TSH normal.  
8. Glaucoma. 
9. Anxiety.  Being followed by Psychiatry on an active
basis.  This was apparently a large factor during her recent
hospitalizations.  
10. Possible recent anemia.  Has not been evaluated thus
far.  

MEDICATIONS:
1. Lisinopril 40 mg p.o. q.d.
2. Synthroid 100 mcg p.o. q.d.
3. Lasix 10 mg p.o. Qa m and Qpm
4. Glyburide 5 mg p.o. b.i.d.
5. Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. to t.i.d.
6. Enteric-coated baby aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d.
7. Sodium chloride 1 g p.o. Qa m via G-tube
8. Timolol 0.5%, one drop to the right eye q.d. 
9. Prevacid 30 mg p.o. q.d.
10. Normal saline 300 cc via G-tube after breakfast, lunch,
and dinner
11. Multivitamin p.o. q.d.
12. Coumadin, with goal INR 2.5 to 3.0 (followed by Internal Medicine)
13. Xalatan 0.005%, one drop each eye q.h.s.
14. Dulcolax 5 mg p.o. q.d. PRN, constipation
15. Risperdal 0.125 mg to 0.25 mg p.o. q.h.s. PRN
16. Ambien 5 mg to 10 mg p.o. q.h.s. PRN
17. Saliva substitute PRN
18. Nystatin, swish-and-swallow PRN
19. Fleet Enema PRN
20. Tylenol 650 mg p.o. PRN

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.  

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient has four children.  Her
daughter Fitzpatrick is a Food Service Supervisor.  Another daughter is staying with the
patient full-time.  Visiting nurse is involved.  Previous to
the last few months, the patient was fairly independent. 

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  
GENERAL:  Cachectic, anxious woman, who is slightly unsteady
on her feet, but safe with ambulation if she moves slowly
and carefully.  Has a cane, but does not always use it.  
VITAL SIGNS:  BP 214/108, initially (patient very anxious),
and 171/74 on repeat.  Pulse 80.  Weight 146.5 pounds, fully
clothed.  
ABDOMEN:  With good bowel sounds.  Soft, nontender and
nondistended.  No hepatosplenomegaly.  No masses.  G-tube is
flushed with water, and flushes easily.  G-tube site itself
is well-healed and nontender, with no pussy discharge.  
LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation.  
HEART:  Regular rate and rhythm.  No murmurs.  

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 
1. Weight loss.  Probably due to poor caloric intake.  This
is a significant health concern for her, as she has become
progressively cachectic and weak.  This is probably
attributed to, by some extent, her progressive dysphagia. 
She is referred urgently to Nutrition, and will see them on
Tuesday.  I suggested to the daughter and to the nutritionist
that we transition her to tube feeds for at least a couple
of weeks, to get her muscle mass up, and then reevaluate. 
She should continue to take p.o. foods as tolerated, but she
needs to attempt to meet her caloric intake via the G-tube,
since she is clearly not meeting it p.o.  Will try Glucerna
because of her diabetes history.  The patient's daughter and
the nutritionist are aware of her issues with vitamin K and
Coumadin, and they will discuss this further when she sees
Nutrition Clinic in two days.  
2. Cerebrovascular disease.  Followed closely by Neurology. 
No acute change in neuro status today.  Will continue
Coumadin.  Being followed closely by Internal Medicine for
this.  Recent INR 1.4.  Will adjust Coumadin as advised by
IM nurse.  
3. SIADH.  I need to review these records more closely, and
try to make sure there is no other underlying disorder.  In
the meantime, her sodiums have been quite good recently. 
4. Diabetes.  Recent hyperglycemia, with sugars in the 300
to 350 range.  Most recently, with sugars in the 100 to 200
range over the past few days.  Continue glyburide 5 mg p.o.
b.i.d.  Finger-sticks three to four times daily.  Further
adjustments PRN.  Our current goal is simply to maintain her
sugars between 120 and approximately 220 to 250.  Once her
dietary issues are stabilized, we can aim for slightly
tighter control.  Wish to avoid hypoglycemia, given her
troubles with p.o. intake.    
5. Recent history of bright red blood per rectum.  Daughter
will bring me her recent colonoscopy report, and we will
take it from there. 
6. Constipation.  Continue Colace.  Add Dulcolax PRN. 
Continue Fleet Enema PRN by visiting nurse.  If she does
have chronic constipation, this may impact her appetite and
her ability to eat successfully.  
7. Hypertension.  Currently in reasonable control.  Goal BP
140 to 170, systolic.  Initial severe hypertension this
visit, attributed to anxiety, which clearly is a major issue
for her.  Follow-up at next visit. 
8. Anxiety.  Followed by Psychiatry.  Extensive reassurance
given today to the patient.  She is very concerned about her
weight loss, as am I.  I tried to reassure her that we would
take this seriously and address it in a very rapid fashion. 

Addendum - spoke with psych - they will start paxil 5 mg qd

watch for worsening SIADH and/or anthicholinergic side effects.
9. Multiple other issues.  To be addressed at further
visits.  Given her weight loss and complexity, I will see
her on a weekly basis for the next few weeks, or sooner PRN.
 Daughter has my pager number, and knows how to reach me.

Ms. Quijano is a 61 yo morbidly obese woman with CAD, OA, and CHF who is in for follow-up of these problems.  



History of Present Illness	

She is working every day and feels much better than she did last year.  She has had multiple admissions in the past for CHF and for ischemia.  Recent echo shows septal and apical hypokinesis.  



She has had no chest pain.  She does not complain of SOB.  She does cough, but this is because of the air conditioning and postnasal drip, she believes.  



She also complains of severe knee pain, with the right worse than the left.  She can walk a little, but standing is very painful.  



In addition, she complains of some food intolerance.  She has a hard time eating breakfast because she gets abdominal cramps.  After eating orange juice, she gets terrible cramping and has to run to the bathroom to have a bowel movement.  She has changed her milk to lactaid, which she says helps.  Certain types of salad dressing also cause this reaction.

Dr. Charles Calhoun

Athina, GA 39341





RE: HEATH, QUINTEN M
      MRN: 8059475
      DOB: 08/02/2095


Dear Dr. Calhoun;


We had the pleasure of seeing your patient Quinten Heath today in Internal Medicine in followup for osteoporosis and hypogonadism. 


As you know Mr. Heat is a pleasant 76-year-old man with a history of esophageal cancer status post surgery in 2169, chemotherapy and radiation who had back pain prompting imaging that revealed several vertebral compression fractures and his BMD was consistent with osteoporosis with a T score of minus 4.2 in the lumbar spine and minus 2.3 in the femoral neck. 


We. started zoledronic acid IV in 05/2171 that he tolerated fine. 


In addition, we discovered primary hypogonadism with testosterone levels around 45 mg/dL and elevated FSH and LH levels. We started AndroGel therapy for testosterone replacement and appeared that he is taking every day.  He does not really feel any better or stronger with this medication. 


PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 
1. Osteoporosis. 
2. Hypogonadism. 
3. History of esophageal cancer status post esophagectomy in 2169, adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation therapy. 
4. Gastroesophageal reflux disease. 
5. Hypertension. 
6. Diabetes type 2. 
7. Carotid artery disease, left. 
8. Hypercholesterolemia. 
9. Status post AAA repair in 2165. 
10. Coronary artery disease with status post stent. 


REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: He is anxious because he has some swallowing problems and fears that his esophageal disease is acting up and he is anticipating a CAT scan in a few days. 


MEDICATIONS: Tricor, metoprolol, Prilosec, Lipitor, aspirin, Plavix, Isordil, Zoloft, vitamin C, Centrum Caltrate plus D 600 mg twice a day, zoledronic acid 4 mg IV once a year and AndroGel 5 grams once a day. 


ALLERGIES: Tape. 


SOCIAL HISTORY: He is married and has 3 children. 


Vital signs: Blood pressure 118/48, pulse 68, weight 136 pounds. Height 5 feet 4 inches. 


LABORATORY EVALUATION: His testosterone level on AndroGel is normal at 292 mg/dL (normal 195-1138) on 09/13/2171. His hematocrit is 39. It was 37 in 02/2171.. Platelets are 179,000. White count 4.8. 


In summary, Mr. Heath is a 76-year-old man with osteoporosis and compression fractures probably secondary to hypogonadism and therapy for esophageal cancer. The cause of hypogonadism is probably the chemotherapy. I asked him again to see a urologist to rule out other causes of primary hypogonadism. 


He will continue the current treatment with calcium, vitamin D, testosterone and antiresorptive therapy of his yearly zoledronic acid. 
We will repeat a BMD in 2 years from now. 


Please let me know if you have any questions. 


Yours sincerely,

                     CARDIOLOGY OFFICE NOTE
 
NOTE
     Ms. Uher returns after a 4  year hiatus.  She is now 52 and
has long-standing insulin dependant diabetes with a h/o retinopathy
OS, possible peripheral neuropathy but not known nephropathy.  She
had a maximal negative exercise test in 2059 and has felt generally
well since that time.  Over the past year she has not been as
careful as previously with her diet and has not been checking her
sugars regularly.  A random cholesterol w/i the past year was over
300.
     She has intermittently had sharp, brief discomforts of the
anterior chest lasting only seconds and not accompanied by dyspnea,
diaphoresis or light-headedness.  There has not been any reduction
in her physical capacity, in fact, she feels stronger than a year
ago and is working full-time.  There has been no orthopnea, PND or
peripheral edema.  She is interested in increasing her physical
activity program.
     Cardiac risk factors include remote smoking, stopped by age
20, hypercholesterolemia and family history in that her father
developed coronary disease possibly in his 50's.  She is
perimenopausal and has discussed later estrogen usage with her
gynecologist Dr. Bradley Brandt.
     Her only medication is lente insulin taken twice per day.
 
EXAM
     She is comfortable at rest.  BP 110/76, HR 80 and reg.  No
JVD.  Carotids full w/o bruits.  Chest clr.  Cardiac exam shows
normal heart sounds w/o gallop or murmur.  Abd. soft w/o
organomegaly.  No peripheral edema.
     Resting EKG shows sinus rhythm with normal intervals and axis
and is a normal tracing.
     For further evaluation of her chest discomforts and to help
gauge her exercise program an exercise treadmill test was performed
using the standard bruce protocol.  She exercised for 9 minutes, 8
seconds and stopped because of knee discomfort but not because of
chest pain or inordinate dyspnea.  Peak heart rate was 143 (85%
maximal predicted) with an appropriate rise in systolic pressure. 
There were no diagnostic changes of ischemia at this good work
load.  Compared to the test of 9/15/59 she exercised 1 minute, 4
seconds longer.
 
IMPRESSION
     1.  No evidence of clinical coronary disease at this time. 
She has major risk factors of insulin dependant diabetes,
hypercholesterolemia, family h/o coronary disease and a
perimenopausal state.  She will be seeing Dr. David Yun as
her primary care provider, and would urge that a fasting lipid
profile be obtained and that dietary/pharmacologic therapy be 
PAGE 2
UHER,OLGA
12/31/63
 
 
instituted to achieve an LDL cholesterol <130.  From a cardiac
standpoint, post-menopausal estrogen therapy would be desired.  Low
dose aspirin therapy could also be considered.
     I would be happy to see Ms. Uher for additional cardiac
evaluation as needed in the future.

EDVISIT^03689964^VALENZUELA, BRIAN^08/09/93^BOYER, DAWN

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Fever.

I saw this patient with Dr. Edwards.  Please see his note for

further details.  I confirm that I have interviewed and examined

the patient, reviewed the resident's documentation, and

discussed, plan of care, and disposition with the patient. 

History is obtained through discussion with the patient who says

yes or no, as well as transporting paramedics.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 56-year-old

gentleman with end-stage MS at nursing home.  He has indwelling

Foley catheter.  He was transported from nursing home to ED as he

has had a fever today to approximately 100.5.  Per EMS, they were

told that the patient has also been more lethargic with decreased

POs today.  He received Tylenol and defervesced somewhat.  He

then received 400 mL of fluid en route and he has become more

awake and alert.  He is telling the paramedics that he is at his

baseline.  He denies to me any headaches, neck pain.  No chest

pain, shortness of breath, no abdominal pain, no cough, no fevers

or chills.  He reports that he is able to discern when he has

abdominal pain.  He has intact sensation.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  As per HPI.  In addition, CAD, diabetes,

hypertension, CHF.

Please see resident note for list of medication and allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He does not smoke.  He does not drink.  He is at

a nursing home.  He is married.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  As per resident note and my HPI.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  He is awake, alert, and nontoxic, in no

distress.  Afebrile, pulse in 90s, respiratory 18, blood pressure

102/66, O2 saturation 99% on room air.  HEENT exam: 

Normocephalic and atraumatic.  Neck:  Supple.  He has coarse

upper airway sounds bilaterally anteriorly.  Heart is regular

rate and rhythm.  His abdomen is slightly distended.  He is

nontender.  He has sacral decubitus ulcers that are well healing,

no evidence of acute infection, contractures in his lower

extremities.  He is alert and does say yes or no to questions.

The most likely etiology in this patient for an infection is his

urinary tract infection.  His urine and his catheter was cloudy. 

Prior to sending the urine for evaluation for urinalysis to the

lab, the patient had his catheter changed.  He then began to no

longer drain urine.  Accordingly, a bladder probe was put on

using ultrasound and clearly showed a distended bladder. 

Attempts were made to change the catheter, but they were

unsuccessful.  There was pus found at the meatus.  At this point,

the patient is awaiting a CT scan of his abdomen and urology

evaluation.  He is also receiving antibiotics for presumed UTI

and/or abscess.

LABORATORY DATA:  Include sodium 136, K 4.5, chloride 102,

bicarbonate 22, BUN 22, creatinine 0.45, and glucose 136.  LFTs

within normal limits.  Normal lipase.  White count of 5.7,

hematocrit 35.5, and platelet count 306,000.  Coags within normal

limits.  UA again is pending at this time.

He will be admitted to the hospital.  I attempted to reach the

patient's primary care physician, Dr. Earle to contact from the

WBM office, however, my calls went unanswered.  At this point, I

am signing out the patient and he is awaiting his CT scan and

urology evaluation.

DIAGNOSIS:  Urinary infection, mild dehydration, end-stage MS.

CONDITION:  Stable.

DISPOSITION:  Will be admitted.

Internal Medicine

Barton Memorial Hospital

 

RE:  Jennifer Vance

     MR #542-66-00-3

 

Dear Vester:

 

Mrs. Vance presents to the office today for general cardiac

evaluation.  As her history is well known to you, I will repeat it

briefly for our records.  Mrs. Vance is a 47-year-old woman with

a history of variegata porphyria, insulin dependent diabetes and

significant coronary artery disease.  In 2061, after a four to five

day history of retrosternal chest discomfort, she was admitted to

the Barton Memorial Hospital where coronary angiography

revealed a 95% proximal left anterior descending artery stenosis. 

She underwent balloon angioplasty of her LAD times two with

inadequate results.  She therefore was taken electively for

coronary artery bypass graft surgery with placement of a left

internal mammary artery to her LAD.  She subsequently continued to

have chest discomfort and underwent repeat cardiac catheterization

in May of 2063 at which time coronary angiography revealed a 60%

stenosis in the proximal left anterior descending artery and a 50%

stenosis in the mid right coronary artery.  The catheterization

report does not indicate the status of her left internal mammary

artery graft.  Since then, she has continued to have episodes of

intermittent abdominal discomfort.  She recently has undergone an

extensive evaluation by the gastroenterology service for her

abdominal pain without specific pathology being discovered.  Trials

of H2 blockers and proton pump inhibitors have been ineffective. 

In November of 2068, she underwent a Bruce protocol stress test

exercising for eight minutes to a peak heart rate of 131, peak

blood pressure of 188/82 stopping because of fatigue.  She had no

ischemic changes on electrocardiogram.  Over the past two weeks

however, she has noticed that her chronic abdominal pain syndrome

(which she often describes as feeling like indigestion) now

includes radiation to her left shoulder.  The pain is not

exacerbated by position, time of day or any particular activity. 

The pain does not awaken her from sleep nor does it occur at rest. 

Of note, her lipid profile from October 2068 indicates a

cholesterol of 229, triglyceride of 68, HDL 51, LDL of 164.  Vance, Jennifer

MR #542-66-00-3                    -2-            July 18, 2069

 

Past medical history is notable for variegata porphyria, insulin

dependent diabetes, right hand carpal tunnel syndrome, Dupuytren's

contracture and tendinitis and hypertension.

 

Medications at Present:  Enteric coated aspirin one tab po q.d.,

NPH insulin 25 units sub q qAM, CZI 10 units sub q qAM.

 

Allergies:  None.

 

Cigarettes - none.  Ethanol - social.

 

Family history is notable for her father dying from carcinoma,

mother dying of colon cancer, question coronary disease, one

brother having a myocardial infarction at age 25, another brother

dying from melanoma age 36.  The rest of her siblings and children

have not heart disease.

 

Physical exam reveals a delightful woman in no acute distress. 

Blood pressure right arm sitting 110/64, heart rate 85 and regular,

respirations 12 and unlabored, weight 104 pounds.  The neck is

supple.  JVP flat.  Carotids are 2+ with bilateral soft right

greater than left bruits.  Chest is clear.  Cardiac exam shows a

normal S1, physiologically split S2 and a I/VI systolic ejection

murmur radiating from the apex to the base, no significant

diastolic murmur.  The abdomen is benign.  Extremities reveal no

appreciable edema.  Peripheral pulses are intact.  

 

Electrocardiogram shows sinus rhythm at a rate of 85.  PR interval

of .12, QRS .06, QT .36, axis 85 degrees.  There are minor

nonspecific ST-T wave changes.  

 

Impression:  Mrs. Vance is a 47-year-old woman with a history of

variegata porphyria, insulin dependent diabetes, hypertension and

dyslipidemia with known coronary artery disease.  She has had a

retrosternal chest pain syndrome for the past several years and her

most recent stress test approximately one year ago did not show

significant provokable ischemia.  Nonetheless, I am concerned that

her clinical presentation may still represent recurrent ischemia. 

I therefore have scheduled her for an exercise MIBI stress test and

I will obtain both an echocardiogram and carotid noninvasive

studies.  In light of her significant dyslipidemia and insulin

dependent diabetes, I strongly recommend beginning aggressive

antilipemic pharmacologic therapy.  Unless her variegata porphyria

precludes the use of atorvastatin, I would begin this at 10 mg po

q.d.  I would target her LDL cholesterol to less than 90.  In

addition, I have started her on atenolol at 25 mg po q.d. and

I would consider beginning an ACE inhibitor again if her

porphyria does not 

Vance, Jennifer

MR #542-66-00-3                    -3-            July 18, 2069

 

preclude this.  She understands that if she has evidence for

significant provokable ischemia that I would strongly encourage her

to undergo repeat coronary angiography.  Thank you very much for

allowing me to assist in her care.

 

Sincerely yours,

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Chest pain.

I confirm that I have seen and evaluated this patient, reviewed

the resident's documentation, discussed the evaluation, plan of

care, and disposition with the patient.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 65-year-old gentleman with

a history of coronary artery disease who is transferred here from

an outlying institution after an episode of left chest radiated

to his arm that awoke him from sleep at about 11 o'clock.  This

resolved after some sublingual nitroglycerin at the hospital but

was associated with some diaphoresis.  He cannot tell if it is

like his previous coronary pain or not.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Negative for nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,

abdominal pain, fever, or chills.  Otherwise, negative.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY, MEDICATIONS, ALLERGIES, SOCIAL, AND FAMILY

HISTORY:  As per the chart.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Shows a well-developed morbidly obese

gentleman snoring in the bed in no acute distress.  He is

asymptomatic when I see him and complaining of being tired. 

HEENT is normocephalic, atraumatic.  Oropharynx is unremarkable. 

Neck is supple.  Chest is clear.  Abdomen is morbidly obese,

soft, and nontender.  Extremities are without cyanosis, clubbing,

or edema.

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  The patient has an EKG, an abnormal

but unchanged in comparison with previously.  He had a total

troponin here of 0.99 equal to the 0.1 at the outlying

institution.  His MB is 8 with a CK of 242.  His creatinine is

also 4.5.

PLAN:  Admission to the hospital for further evaluation.

DIAGNOSIS:  Non-Q-wave, non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction.

DISPOSITION:  The patient is admitted for further care.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

56 yo M h/o CAD s/p BMS x2 to RCA, HTN, HLD, diet-controlled DM, smoking, p/w chest pain at rest



#) Chest Pain: Certain aspects of the history (similar to previous e/o angina, sudden onset, relief with NTG) are concerning for cardiac cause. The subtle but real changes in the ECG and the non-zero troponin are also concerning. Other etiologies include anxiety (pt described a sense of doom), pulmonary causes (less likely given nl exam and lack of hypoxia), musculoskeletal (pt denies trauma), PE (pt is not tachycardic or hypoxemic).

-Telemetry

-f/u repeat troponin, CK-MB

-If positive will start heparin gtt

-If negative will continue to cycle enzymes

-Treadmill stress w/imaging in AM

-Continue ASA 325mg, Plavix

-f/u LFTs given CK elevation but continue home statin (no increase in dose given c/f statin myopathy)



#) Thrombocytopenia: appears to be longstanding and stable by labs. The most likely etiology is HCV given the strong association of HCV with thrombocytopenia and his longstanding disease. Other possibilities include Plavix effect (although thrombocytopenia predates starting plavix), alcohol (although pt claims abstinence), or ITP. Hypoproductive etiologies are less likely given nl WBC and Hct. 

-f/u smear

-monitor CBC



#) HTN: Well controlled on arrival

-Continue Lisinopril 5mg PO daily, Propanolol 80mg PO BID (given bradycardia may need to decrease dose although currently tolerating well)



#) HLD: Given CK elevation will defer acutely increasing statin dose

-6/70 lipids LDL 45, HDL 35, TG 123

-Simvastatin 40mg PO qPM



#) DM: most recent A1c 6.7

-FSBG AC+HS

-RISS AC



#) HBV: given h/o HBVcAB pos with HBVsAg neg and HBVsAb neg likely either  chronic seropositive occult HBV with extremely low-level viremia not triggering surface antibody response, or resolved acute HBV having lost high antibody titers over time.

-s/p HBV vaccine x4 doses, most recently 7/70

-f/u repeat HBVsAb repeat to assess response to vaccine

-f/u HBV DNA to eval for occult chronic infection



#) HCV: s/p PEG IFN and Ribavirin 3/65-9/65 with inadequate tx response

-Up to date on HCC screening (AFP and ultrasound within last year)

ID CONSULT NOTE 


PATIENT NAME:  Vincent Ware
MRN: 98044905

DATE OF ADMISSION: 3/02/75
DATE OF CONSULT: 3/03/75
ID ATTENDING: Haney


ID FELLOW: Riddle

SERVICE ATTENDING: Vann
REASON FOR CONSULT: Cough, dyspnea, fevers s/p HSCT off immune suppression


HPI:

Mr. Ware is a 67-year-old man with a history non-Hodgkins's lymphoma (spinal mass, s/p CHOP, radiation, in long term remission) and secondary MDS s/p reduced intensity allo-HSCT 12/73.  His post-tx course was unremarkable.  Peritransplant he devloped a multifocal PNA of unclear etiology. Pretransplant imaging showed peribronchial thickening, and post transplant a tree &amp; bud appearance with more focal areas of consolidation. Per the patient, he had a dry hacking cough with occaisional fevers and night sweats that lasted from April through November of 73 and resolved on their own.  He had several courses of quinolones (and other abx) during this period without significant relief, but ultimately his symptoms improved on their own.  His immune suppression was d/c'd 7/74.  He deveoloped iron overload (Ferritin 1356) and started phlebotomy 9/74.   


Mr. Ware did well from a respiratory standpoint until 11/74 when he noticed intermittent fevers approximately every 2 weeks.   At first they were in the 99 range and they would last 1-2days and be associated with malaise.  He also again experienced symptoms of a dry hacking cough that occurs with change in positioning (not necessarily lying flat).  By the end of November, the fevers were a bit higher (100.5).  He saw his PCP who thought he might have PNA.  He obtained a CXR and gave hime a course ofr azithromycin (5d). His fevers improved.  In early December, he began experienceing SOB with exertional dyspnea.  He saw his PCP again who rx avelox.  He got another CXR which showed some ""fluid"" and was strated on lasix.  He was also referred for echocardiogram, PFTs, and chest CT.  On arrival, he was found to be in AFB w/RVR. 


He was admitted from 12/21-01/02. He was rate controlled and had minimal diuresis.  Cardiac MRI suggested constrictive pericarditis and possible areas of active pericarditis.  Right &amp; left heart cath which showed no evidence of cosntriction hemodynamically. He had 1 temperature to 101.4, and given his history he was seen by our service.  Blood cultures were negative. Induced sputum was negative for AFB x 3. He and influenza/rsv/paraflu/adnevorus nasal swabs which were also negative. Sputum cultures grew oral flora. CMV VL, glucan, and galactomannan were also negative. 


He improved w/regard to SOB but cough persisted.  He was seen by Dr. Vann who was concerned for an immunologic process given his bilateral pleural effusions &amp; question of pericarditis. He had a URI syndrome in January that lasted 3 weeks then resolved.  On February 19th, he noticed the onset of low-grade temps (100.0-100.5) with malaise and mild chills.  These happened nightly through. He saw his PCP 2/23 who rx moxifloxacin. He had no change in his symptoms.  He had some mild rhinorrhea and mildly increased SOB.  He denies CP, abdominal pain, HA, N/V/D, joint pain, skin rashes, dysuria.  His son had a ""head cold"" prior to the onset of his symptoms.  No other sick contacts.  He was admitted for further workup. 



He is up tp date received influenza &amp; pneumococcal vaccines.

Increased moderate effusions since 1/29/2075.
CHEST CT 3/03: Pericardial effusion has resolved without apparent  change in bilateral pleural effusions since 12/14/2074. Prior granulomatous infection is evident. 



TTE:
The left ventricle is normal in size. Overall left ventricular function is mildly to moderately reduced. The estimated ejection fraction is 40-45%. There is global hypokinesis with regional  variation. There is septal ?bounce? raising the possibility of constrictive  physiology.
IMPRESSION &amp; RECOMMENDATIONS:
67yoM with h/o NHL in remission, secondary MDS s/p non myeloabaltive allo BMT now off all immune suppression since 7/74 presenting with fevers, SOB, and malaise.  He has not yet had documented fevers in the hospital, but his rhinorrhea after sick contact during this season is suggestive of a viral syndrome.  He has chronically mildly elevated LFTs which are stable.  He has a new mild eospinophila of unclear etiology. 
-nasopharyngeal swab AND pertussis IgM/IgG for pertussis given persistent cough and low grade temps
-f/u respiratory viral panel
-given mild eosinophilia, can check strongyloides antibody and stool for ova and parasites though no clear exposure history, would also check urinary histo Ag and cocciodes IgM/IgG (given old granulomatous disease on chest CT)
-would consider AM cortisol to r/o adrenal insufficiency 
-would repeat hepatitis serologies (HepB sAG, cAB, sAB, HepA AB, HepC Ab) given persistent mildly elevated LFTs
-would check toxoplasma DNA given risk of dz post-transplant

COMPARISON: 12/22/86          FINDINGS:     Lines/tubes:  None.          Lungs and pleura:  There is continued right mid and lower chest     opacity consistent with loculated pleural fluid and atelectasis.     This appearance of fluid has decreased slightly since the previous     study. There is no  pneumothorax. No focal consolidation is     demonstrated in the left hemithorax.  There may be a small     posterior left pleural effusion as well. There is subtle     suggestion of Kerley B lines at the lung bases consistent with     mild CHF.          Heart and mediastinum:  The heart and the mediastinum are     unchanged from the prior study. The aortic arch is calcified and     tortuous.          Bones:  The thoracic skeleton is unchanged from the prior study.          IMPRESSION:     Continued signs of atelectasis and pleural fluid involving     predominantly the right mid and lower hemithorax.  The appearance     of this has improved slightly since the prior exam.  No new focal     consolidation is demonstrated compared to the prior study.          There is subtle suggestion of Kerley B lines consistent with mild     CHF.     Plan:
1. Recurrent pleural effusion: for repeat CT chest. Continue treatment for CAP.
2. Hematuria: hold off Coumadin at present. Monitor Foley drainage. Consult Urology if no resolution. Otherwise for outpatient follow-up.
3. Hodgkin's Lymphoma: Alert Dr Joyce of admission as courtesy.
4. A Fib: rate controlled at present. Hold off Coumadin. 
5. HTN: BP poorly controlled. For admission anti-hypertensives. Monitor.
6. Psych: he appears depressed. Likely reactive to current poor health. I will alert PCP.
7. Code: FULL
8. Family: Daughter present and aware of plan

HPI: Ms Uher was doing well until 8/70 when she she was noted to have several ""staring spells."" At the same time she had increased gait instability leading to admission to SLMC. A head MRI was reportedly normal. She improved and was discharged without treatment or diagnosis. At that time she also noticed subtle decline in visual acuity and eye exam confirmed this. She was told that this was caused by her diabetes. Her vision continued to worsen and she was treated with laser OS. Over the past month her balance has worsened nad her vision has continued to deteriorate. She reports severe HA in 8/70 but none recently. She was seen by ophtalmology at SGAH and noted to have optic disc swelling, cotton wool spots and hemorrhages. She was sent to CCH EW for evaluation.

Record date: 2082-09-29

I have personally reviewed the history, examined the patient, and reviewed and edited the note and I agree with the assessment and plan developed under my personal supervision as documented by previosu PA note from Ursula Bowers, PA-C. Please see additional comments below.

Vicente Aguilar is a 49 y/o male with cystic fibrosis, moderate to severe lung disease, colonized with mucoid-type Pseudomonas aeruginosa pancreatic insufficiency, CF related DM, HTN, renal insufficiency with proteinuria, recent h/o CVA, gout, cataracts who is currently experiencing a subacute exacerbation of his pulmonary disease requiring hospitalization to initiate IV antibiotics. His symptoms include long-standing fatigue, increased cough and sputum production, some SOB with mild chest tightness and wheezing. His FEV1 significantly decreased during recent clicni visit. He also reports some sinus headaches, but denies sinus pain or tenderness.  He denies hemoptysis, fever/chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or constipation.  Please see details regarding recent MRI/MRA results on PA note above, as well as medications, and other pertinent historical data reviewed independently. 

VSS: afebrile, oxygen saturation 
Gen: alert, NAD
HEENT: sclera clear, persistent visual defects right upper quadrant visual field, neck supple
CV: regular
Lungs: essentially clear with good aeration, no wheezes wuth few scattered ronchi. 
Abdomen: soft, NT, ND, no masses
Ext: warm, clubbing
Neuro: normal gait, oriented x 3.

Assessment/Plan: Vicente Aguilar is a 49 y/o male with cystic fibrosism noderate to severe lung disease with past medical history as noted above who is currently experiencing a subacute exacerbation of his pulmonary disease requiring hospitalization to initiate IV antibiotics

1. PULM/ID: We will start treatment with tobramycin 700 mg IV q am, as well as  Ceftazidime 2 g IV q 8 hours based on culture results. We will continue maintenance pulmonary medications including bronchodilators, mucolytics and steroids. We will discuss hypertonic saline therapy and trial its use if agreeable. We will send a new sputum sample for culture. Chest x-ray after PICC placement. Will review routine admission labs.

2. CVS: monitor blood pressure assess need for other protective medications. Will continue antihypertensives, ACEi and ARB if creatinine stable. We will review findings from recent MRI/MRA. Check lipid profile if not done, on Zocor. 

3. FEN/GI: High calorie, high protein CF diet. 

4. Renal: check electrolytes, as well as UA with random protein and creatinine. His creatinine was elevated to 1.6, now 1.5 and was 1.1-1.4 at baseline. He described an incident last week with nausea and vomiting that likely led to above result while taking colchicine, celebrex, and other meds. This is probabyl on its way to improvement. We did not hold ACEi and ARB at this time, but will repeat Cr tonight. He will drink fluids during the day priro to PICC by IR. He does not have a nephrologist adn will need to find him one. He did have a renal biopsy in teh late 60s adn thus will look for results, but renal disease likely multigfactorial. We will tobra levels bvery close adn started at low dose for his size. Will likely check renal US while here.

5. Endo: continue insulin regimen. He will check blood sugars more frequently and folow HgA1c. He did state that he occasionally gets blood sugars in the 40s when he wakes up, but usually nto when he is sedentary, ie. admitted to hospital. IF BS normal here, he will check them very closely at home as well and make adjustments as necesary. We will also need toset him up with Endocrinologist. 

6. Access: PICC line to be placed in IR

7. Dispo: 14 day of inpatient IV antibiotics

8. Neuro: He was last seen by Neurologist on 8/30 and was discharged from routine follow-up. He will continue anti-hypertensive meds and ASA. He contineu sot have visual deficit in R upper quadrant.

A/P:

1)CAD- will look for correspondence from Dr. Mora re: his thoughts.  Consider adding low dose beta blocker, since BP is a little.  Needs mor aggressive lowereing of lipid.  At next visit, repeat lipid, and consider lipitor.

2)Back pain- suspect there is some somatization, but patient is far from being able to accept this.  For now, refilled Ibupfofen and follow how often she refills.  Note in record of patient requesting Vicodan, which was given to her before by Dr. Solomon.  Would avoid if possible.

3)Anxiety- Valium 5 mg #15 mg, prn. Offer counseling at next visit if persists.

4)HMC- will ofer colonoscopy at next visit.

54 yo male from Kazakhstan here for f/u of GI mucor.  Briefly, he was admitted 6/20/62 with DKA and MSSA bacteremia.  He was found to have perirectal abscess s/p CT-guided drains as well as L hip infected prosthesis and abscess s/p removal and drainage in OR on 7/07 and by IR 7/22, both sites positive for MSSA.  Hospital course c/b GIB and was found to have free air with perforated duodenum s/p ex-lap 6/22, gastrectomy with partial large bowel resection, splenectomy and primary anastamosis, with path positive for mucormycosis without clean margins.  He also had VRE/klebsiella LUQ abscess s/p IR drainage.  

He was initially treated with nafcillin and ambisome, but developed maculopapular rash on chest and arms thought to be secondary to nafcillin.  So he was switched to vanco/ambisome/linezolid/meropenem/amikacin for LUQ abscess.  After 6 weeks of high-dose ambisome, he was taken back to OR on 7/31 for re-exploration and was found to have some more necrosis around his esophageal-jejunostomy site that surgeons ""scooped out"" as much as they could, but were not able to get clean margins because of difficult anatomic restrictions. 
Given the inability to completely en-bloc resect Mr. Ethridge's GI mucor despite a long-trial of Ambisome, he was started on an investigational drug, posaconazole, provided by Emcor on a compassionate use basis.  This has had 50% success of curing mucor as salvage therapy in small trials.  He was started on this drug on 8/28/62 and has tolerated it well despite some nausea, diarrhea.  

He has been at EDUCARE-FARGO reports increase in strength and improved ability to bear weight on his hip.  He walks with a walker.  He had repeat CT abd/pelvix 10/26 which showed no intraabdominal collection and stable L hip collection.  He had abd drains removed 3 weeks ago but continues to have L hip drain, without much output.  He was started on TPN 1 week ago due to maltrition, despite po intake.  He has been trying to eat, but reports some nausea and diarrhea, especially after he eats and since starting posaconazole.  He reports good glycemic control.

54 yo male with DM s/p long hospital course for DKA, multiple infections in hip and abd, and GI mucor s/p resection x2, but with residual disease.  Currently on posaconazole and tolerating well, but does have significant nausea, somewhat controlled with zofran.  Diarrhea can be a component posaconazole side effect, or due to dumping syndrome.



Plan:

1) continue posaconazole

2) need to have ortho f/u to evaluate L hip collection

3) RTC in 1 month 12/04/62 at 10am to f/u for posaconazole.  Will need EKG again at EDUCARE-FARGO before transfer here.



Mr. Ethridge seen and examined with Dr. Roberts.  He is very slowly improving in terms of strength, no doubt in part due to nocturnal TPN.  Hard to tease out the cause of his nausea, although anatomic reasons are as likely as medication side effects.  On balance, if his labs are ok, I'd favor continuing the posaconazole given most recent OR findings.  ECG without QTc prolongation.  Abdomen is bening.  Left hip still sore, but more and more stable.

NAME:     Upham, Zelda

MRN:      9656797



Patient is here for a follow-up.  Patient has returned from her trip to Hong Kong.  Says

that it was a bit stifling, because she cannot drive and was dependent on other people

for transportation.



Still has severe right shoulder pain.  Still also complaining of left jaw pain, that is

worse when she has to open her mouth very widely.  Reviewed x-rays, which were

negative for fracture of frontal facial bones, and did not reveal obvious abnormality in

the TMJ area.  Has yet to receive an appointment from Dr. Vann for this

shoulder pain.



Patient was afraid to try the Vioxx, because she was told by the pharmacist that she

could not take it with ibuprofen. I explained to her that she should take the Vioxx in

place of the ibuprofen and she understands.  Is not willing to try Flexeril. 



Patient spent approximately 20 minutes describing her dissatisfaction and difficult

interactions with her children.  Has not asked for more Valium.  Has never been

interested in counseling prior to today.  Did not become tearful like she has in the

past.  



Asked for refill of sublingual nitroglycerin.  Prescription apparently was given to her

last spring.  Complains also of upper chest wall tenderness.  No clear to me what

causes her to take the sublingual nitroglycerine, but says when she takes it, it relieves

her symptoms.  I have asked her if this pain is ever exertional, or is the same pain

that is reproducible when she touches her chest.  The patient seems to label her chest

wall pain as the same as pain that she gets with exertion.  



PROBLEMS: As per LMR.



MEDICATIONS: As per LMR.



ALLERGIES: As per LMR.



PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: WD/WN female in NAD. Blood pressure 150/80.

Pulse 80 and regular.  Weight 152 pounds.  Lungs: Clear bilateral breath sounds. 

COR: RRR. S1 and S2 without murmurs noted.  Extremities: No lower extremity

edema.  Soreness over posterior right upper trapezius.  Full range of motion of

shoulders. No tenderness over AC joints.  Chest wall tenderness over superior aspect

of sternum and its border on left.  No masses or deformity noted.



ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  



(1)  Chest pain: Certainly overdue for a follow-up with her cardiologist, Dr. Hunter

     Mccarthy.  Referral done.  Also referred sublingual nitroglycerin.



(2)  Elevated blood pressure.  Better than last visit, but remains slightly elevated. 

     At last visit, patient was reluctant to start a beta blocker.  Think she may need

     this at future visit.  Will also refer back to her cardiologist.



(3)  Elevated lipids, last checked last year. Several medications that patient appears

     to be sensitive to side effects.  At next visit, will give lab slip to repeat fasting

     profile. Positive checkup.  Would probably benefit from lipid lowering.



(4)  Leg cramps.  Toward end of visit, patient also complained of more than 25

     years of leg cramps.  Unable to take quinine because of allergic reaction. 

     Patient already takes Valium p.r.n. and I am reluctant to start any other

     anxiolytics.  Will check electrolytes and calcium at next visit. 



(5)  History of sciatica.  Patient states in past that she has received steroid injection

     for her lower back pain, which resolved.  Will simply follow with Vioxx, which

     will hopefully help other pains that patient is experiencing.  Also continue with

     her rheumatologist, Dr. Solomon, who has followed her chronic fibromyalgia and

     chronic low back pain.



Return to clinic with me in six to eight weeks. 



ADDENDUM: Patient's referral was receiving by Dr. Vann's office and they tell

me she should be able to get an appointment for 6/95.

OROZCO,KYLE   560-40-78-5                     VISIT DATE: 08/26/83

This is a preliminary dictation. 

PRESENTING COMPLAINT and HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  This 

patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of hypertension and 

diabetes who presents with fever and chills.  He is four weeks 

status post revision of an aorto-bifemoral bypass graft, which got 

infected and had to be revised.  He has been doing well, but now 

presents here with a low-grade fever to 100.9 degrees F. (he states 

his maximum temperature at home was 101 degrees F., while he was 

taking Advil for the fever).  He presents for evaluation.  He has 

had no drainage from the site, and has been home on IV Nafcillin 

for the past two months secondary to his graft infection. 

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  As above. 

MEDICATIONS:  IV Nafcillin, Lasix, Zocor, and insulin. 

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies. 

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The vital signs include a blood pressure of 

179/85, a pulse of 91, respirations of 20, and a fever to 100.9 

degrees F.  The HEENT examination is normal.  There are some 

crackles at the left base, but the lungs are otherwise normal.  The 

heart has a regular rate and rhythm.  The abdomen is soft and 

non-tender, with good bowel sounds.  There is a right groin mass, 

questionably a hematoma, with good pulses however.  The extremities 

are well-perfused. 

LABORATORY EVALUATION:  The electrolytes, BUN, and creatinine are 

normal.  The blood sugar is 180.  The white count is normal at 3.7. 

The hematocrit is 29.  The PT/PTT are pending.  The urinalysis is 

negative so far, with microscopic pending. 

THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  The patient was seen by Surgery. 

The consensus was to order a CT scan of the abdomen, since the 

patient had a fever at that point, and so the CT scan is pending. 

Thus, the assessment was that this was a 58-year-old male with a 

history of a recent revision of an aorto-bifemoral bypass graft, 

who had been on two months of IV Nafcillin, and who presented with 

a fever.  Laboratory studies are done and cultures sent.  A Surgery 

consultation and abdominal CT scan were ordered, and results were 

pending.  The patient was admitted to the Emergency Department 

Observation Unit awaiting the scan, full evaluation, and 

disposition.  The patient was signed out to the 3 p.m. attending. 

CONSULTATIONS (INCLUDING PCP):  Surgery. 

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  Fever. 

DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  The patient is 

admitted to the Emergency Department Observation Unit in stable 

condition.

EKG: ? sinus, abnormal P-waves morphology 



Impr/Plan:  75 yo woman with MVR, HOCM, severe AS who p/w following episode of syncope.



1. Syncope: hx worrisome for cardiac etiology given suddenness of the episode w/o much warning.  Likely etiologies could be some decreased pre-load in setting of recent increased diuresis, perhaps decreased po intake in a woman dependent on preload 2/2 her valvular disease.   In addion, pt could have had an arrythmia which would necessitate interrogating her pacer.  Seizure activity is not part of the hx but the pt does have carotid disease which might have been playing a role as well.

--will check echo in a.m. to assess valvular disease, LV function, could consider stress test

--will consult EP to assess pacer function

--pt has already ruled out for MI but will keep her on monitor at least overnight

--will need to pay close attention to volume status as pt is very preload dependent 

--will re-check carotid studies

--will re-start ASA (it was recently stopped) given carotid and vascular disease



2. CHF: pt carries diagnosis of CHF and CXR c/w some pulmonary congestion.  On exam, pt with crackles bilaterally also c/w pulm edema.

--will cont outpt lasix but need to be very careful given pt's tenous volume status



3. COPD: cont outpt regimen



4. FEN: normal diet, replete lytes as needed



5. proph: boots, TEDS since pt HIT positive, nexium

He notes he has been doing fairly well this last year. He was seen for a physical by his primary care physician Dr Haas on November 13th at which time he reports she told him he was doing well. Dr Mann followed up with her on his lab studies and results and called Mr Aguilar on friday alerting him to the change in his renal function. It was decided that he be admitted for renal work-up as well as initiating cleanout as he does his cleanouts yearly.

He notes he has had erratic control of his blood sugar as he does at times 'forget' to give himself insulin. He does monitoe his BS four times per day. He denies any dysuria, hematuria or urgency. he does note frequency has increased over the year, he now urinates every few hours. He denies any sore throat or sinus pain, does have occasional mild congestion.

She returns to clinic for follow up. Unfortunately she missed her
entire appointment and did not bring her blood glucose log with
her. She reports that at 4 a.m. last Thursday she woke up and felt
disoriented with sweats. She checked her blood glucose, it was 50,
and she treated herself by eating. This led to resolution of her
symptoms, although she said that she overshoots. She has developed
a foot infection, has been seen by a podiatrist and started on
antibiotics. She has also been taking a thyroid hormone but she
still feels that it is making her tired. She just in general has
not been feeling as well as she had been previously.
 
Past Medical History:
 
1.   IDDM.
 
Medications: See previous notes.
 
Allergies:  Same.
 
Physical Examination:  Not performed. The patient had a  special
orthopedic shoe on, her foot was wrapped.
 
Impression:  Patient with IDDM with usual blood glucoses in the
200's and an elevated A1C. Discussed the need for consistent meals
and exercise and need for more control. Will increase day time
insulin to 17 units of Lente and evening will stay at 10. She will
follow up in one month. Will check a TSH today.

ASSESSMENT &amp; PLAN
Mr. Jimenez is a 78 yo male with h/o Hodgkin&#8217;s dz s/p chemo, T2m, HTN, AAA, CHF (last TTE 2086 with LVEF 50%, RVSP 45), a fib on coumadin, recently discharged after prolonged hospital stay for PNA &amp; complicated pleural effusion requiring chest tube placement, now returns from rehab with 20 lb wt gain since discharge on 3/09 &amp; 7.5 lbs since 3/20 &amp; increasing pleural effusion.  Increasing wt gain could be secondary to low ext edema. ?right heart failure 2/2 to pulm htn or perhaps diastolic dysfunction; however BNP not very elevated.  Patient&#8217;s albumin is only slightly below 3.4 as well.  Low suspicion for DVTs given exam with bilateral low ext swelling &amp; recent negative LUE noninvasive.


1.      Low ext edema/wt gain: Patient responding well to IV lasix from ED.
a.     Trial of daily PO lasix
b.     Strict I/O/s, daily wt
c.     Consider a repeat TTE, but recently performed 5 months ago so expect little change.
2.      Loculated pleural effusion:  With effusion enlarging, question if patient would be candidate for decortication/pleurodesis.
a.     Consider thoracic surgery consult
3.      ID: Will hold on further antibiotics at this time.  Afebrile without elev WBC.  Suspect CXR showing increasing pleural effusion.  Low suspicion for PNA.
4.      CV:
a.     Rhythm: Rate control with digoxin, labetalol.  Hold coumadin for elevated INR.  Restart when &lt;3.3.
b.     HTN: Cont Norvasc, labetalol, hydralazin, lisinopril
c.     PVD: Cont statin, ASA
5.      T2DM: Cont NPH 6 units BID + RISS


F/E/N:  No conc sweets.

I saw this patient with Dr. Xavier Palacios.  I confirm that I have

interviewed and examined the patient, reviewed the resident's

documentation on the patient's chart, and discussed the

evaluation, plan of care, and disposition with the patient. 

Please see the resident's note for further details.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Fast heart rate.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 78-year-old female

with history of a left MCA stroke, atrial fibrillation,

hypertension, diabetes, and renal insufficiency who was

transferred from Southwest Montana Radiology for atrial

fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.  The patient has

been in Southwest Montana for the last several weeks.  During her

rehabilitation stay, the patient was noted to have sinus

bradycardia and sinus pauses.  The patient's metoprolol was

stopped.  The patient was previously on metoprolol 6.25 mg every

6 hours.  The patient was noted to have atrial fibrillation with

rapid ventricular response on exam this morning.  The patient is

followed by Dr. Octavia Xue of Heritage Hospital Cardiology. 

Given the difficulty that Southwest Montana has had ____

the patient's atrial fibrillation, the patient was transferred

here to Riverton General Hospital for further management and

further placement.  The patient is asymptomatic.  The patient

denies any chest pain or shortness of breath.  The patient denies

any lightheadedness.  The patient has no other complaints.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient's vital signs revealed the

following:  Temperature is 96.4, heart rate of 79, respiratory

rate of 18, blood pressure is 112/63, and oxygen saturations at

100% on room air.  The patient's oxygen saturation was

interpreted as normal.  General:  No acute distress, pleasant,

and multiple family members at bedside.  HEENT:  The patient's

head was normocephalic.  Mucous membranes were dry.  Posterior

oropharynx was clear.  Neck:  Supple.  No carotid bruits.  No

JVD.  Respiratory:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.  No focal

rhonchi, rales, or wheezes.  Cardiovascular:  Irregularly

irregular, tachycardic.  No gross murmurs, rubs, or gallops were

appreciated.  GI:  Abdomen:  Soft.  No rebound or guarding. 

Minimal suprapubic tenderness to palpation.  G-tube in place. 

Rectal exam:  Deferred.  GU exam:  Deferred.  Skin:  Warm and

dry.  No rash or lesions were noted.  Back:  No costovertebral

angle tenderness.  Extremities:  Warm and well perfused.  Lower

extremity pitting edema rising up to the knees.  No palpable

cords.  Neurologic:  The patient was alert and oriented.  The

patient moved all 4 extremities with fair strength.  The patient

did have a right facial droop.  I did not ambulate the patient.

INITIAL IMPRESSION AND PLAN:  The patient is a 78-year-old female

with history of atrial fibrillation, and recent left MCA stroke

who was transferred from Southwest Montana for management

of her atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.  The

patient is hemodynamically stable at this time.  The patient is

asymptomatic.  The patient will need rate control and will need

to be admitted to Heritage Hospital Cardiology.

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  Upon arrival to the Emergency

Department, the patient had history and physical exam performed. 

The patient then had 12-lead EKG performed.  The patient's

12-lead EKG was notable for atrial fibrillation with rapid

ventricular response.  The patient did have some nonspecific ST-T

changes when compared to her prior EKG.  The patient's laboratory

studies so far has been largely unremarkable.  The patient's

first set of cardiac markers were negative.  The patient's

complete blood count was notable for an elevated white blood cell

count of 10.8.  The patient's hematocrit of 33.2.  The patient's

platelets were somewhat elevated at 560,000.  The patient's

portable chest x-ray has been ordered and results of the

patient's portable chest x-ray are still pending at this time. 

The case was then discussed with the Heritage Hospital

cardiologist on call.  The patient ____ will be admitted to

Heritage Hospital Cardiology and to a monitor bed.  I did try to

page Dr. Octavia Xue to let her know about the patient's

admission to Heritage Hospital Cardiology.  The patient and

patient's family were in agreement with the plan.  The patient

was started on metoprolol down her G-tube.  The patient had a

good response to the metoprolol.  The patient was given

metoprolol 6.25 mg.

PRIMARY DIAGNOSES:

1.  Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.

2.  History of a left MCA stroke.

DISPOSITION:  The patient was admitted to Heritage Hospital

Cardiology.

CONDITION AT TIME OF DISPOSITION:  Stable and satisfactory.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Ms. Vance is a 45 year old woman with diabetes, 
porphyria and coronary artery disease, who came in today for annual visit.  
 
HPI:  
1.   Pain in right hand.  The patient has a Dupuytren's contraction in the 
     right hand.  She did have one in the left hand for which she had 
     surgery in June, 2064.  The surgery was performed by Dr. Peter 
     Vandenberg.  At that time, she also had an ulnar nerve decompression.  
     She had trigger fingers in the left index and ring finger as well, 
     which were repaired.  She is a Transport Operations Supervisor that uses her hands 
     extensively and is very concerned about the pain in her right hand.
2.   Diabetes mellitus.  She only rarely checks her blood sugars.  They 
     tend to run about 160.  She has had diabetes for 28 years.  She takes 
     NPH insulin 25 units sub q q.a.m. and CGI 10 units sub q q.a.m.  She 
     is not on an evening dose.  Her last ophthalmology visit was in 6/66.

     9/61 for isolated lesion.  Since then she has had no angina.  She has 
     been on no medications for coronary artery disease since 2063.  
4.   Left breast lesion.  She was found to have a breast mass in 12/66 and 
     underwent wire localization and biopsy.  At that  time, she had micro 
     calcifications on her mammogram at that time.  The past report 
     revealed atypical ductal hyperplasia only.
 
CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  NPH insulin 25 units sub q q.a.m., CGI 10 units sub 
q q.a.m., Tylenol p.r.n., aspirin 85 mg PO q.d.

3.   Status post CABG.  I started her on atenolol 25 mg PO q.d. given that 
     she does have coronary artery disease, and there is a question as to 
     whether or not she had an MI in 2061, which she will return in one 
     month for blood pressure check and also to review her blood sugars.

She also reports an increased frequency of her chest tightness, occuring mainly at night, sometimes before going to sleep, sometimes durign the night. This is responsive to 1 SL TNG typically, although sometimes is goes away without intervention. She denies SOB, PND, orthopnea, presycope or syncope. She has intermittant mild LE edema. She occasionally has palpitations, lasting ~ 5 minutes, resolving spontaneously. She cannot relate them to any time of day or activity, and they are not associated w/ lightheadedness or CP.

      Assessment and plan:
    Mrs. Vanmeter presents today stating that she continues to have some mild nighttime chest discomfort, responsive to SL TNG. Her last stress test was in January 2082 and was without ischemia with a posterobasal scar (Adeno MIBI). A recent echo in June 2081 done to evaluate increased LE edema was normal.


Problems:
      


Coronary artery disease  -  She reports an increased frequency of her nighttime CP and takes SL TNG when with good relief. Takes it about once/month. These episodes only occur at night when she is in bed.  Her echo showed preserved LV function and no significnat valvular disease.  A repeat adenosine MIBI was negative for recurrent ischemia with an inferobasal scar and LVEF 54%. I advised her to take an H2 blocker before bedtime and if symptoms don't improve, seek a workup with her PCP.


      


Hyperlipidemia  -  Her last lipid profile showed that her LDL was in range at 67, and her TG were normal! I advised her about the metabolic syndrome and the importance of careful diabetic control as well as regular exercise.  Continue her present dose of statin.


      


HTN  -  Her BP is well-controlled today. Continue her current regimen.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Shortness of breath.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 67-year-old female

with end-stage cardiac disease with ischemic cardiomyopathy, who

I see together with the resident.  The resident's history was

reviewed.  The patient was interviewed and examined by me.  In

brief, apparently the EMS was summoned to the scene inadvertently

this morning.  She is end-stage, she is on hospice and comfort

measures only, and she apparently was quite poorly feeling this

morning and was transported.  Her son has called several times

and wants to transport her back in a discussion with her.  She is

quite weak and understands her circumstances, wishes to be

transported back as well.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY, REVIEW OF SYSTEMS, SOCIAL HISTORY,

MEDICATIONS, AND ALLERGIES:  All per the chart.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She is alert.  She certainly appears

end-stage.  She has a JVP at 14-16 cm.  She has lungs with

decreased breath sounds throughout her heart.  There is a 3/6

holosystolic murmur heard very weakly.  Her abdomen is soft and

nontender without organomegaly.

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  She has electrocardiogram, which is

remarkable for sinus rhythm with nonspecific intraventricular

conduction delay and ugly appearing.  Electrocardiogram is rather

wide complexed.  She has a first-degree AV block and a leftward

axis.  The case was discussed with her cardiologist, social

worker, case manager, and family and she is discharged home.

IMPRESSION:  End-stage ischemic cardiomyopathy.

DISPOSITION AND PLAN:  She is discharged home to continue with

hospice and expectant care.

EDVISIT^37199514^WILKERSON, EDWARD^01/17/93^HODGES, CHAD

Please see the written documentation undertaken by Dr. Caldwell,

the resident who saw the patient primarily.  I have seen and

examined the patient personally, reviewed the written

documentation and agree with the assessment and plan.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. Wilkerson is a 68-year-old

gentleman without significant past medical history, who is

actually being seen here by his primary care physician who

happens to be a resident rotating ____ normally sees him in MIMAIMA

Clinic.  According to Dr. Caldwell, his PCP, he generally does

not have very much past medical history, but when he gets

infected, he gets confused.  He presents today with confusion. 

His visiting nurse today noticed that he has been having weakness

and fatigue over the last few days, but today, he was confused as

he has been when he has been ill in the past.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Dementia, SVT, hypertension, and diabetes

type 2.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He is a former smoker.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Otherwise, negative.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Otherwise negative except as previously

dictated.

MEDICATIONS:  Lisinopril, hydrochlorothiazide, omeprazole,

Risperdal, Tegretol, verapamil, and Tylenol #3.

ALLERGIES:  He has no known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  He is a healthy, well-appearing Caucasian

gentleman who nevertheless is disoriented to time.  He knows

place and name.  His heart rate is 101, respiratory rate is 20,

blood pressure is 121/92, and oxygen saturation is 96% on room

air, and his temperature is 101.5.  He had left lower lobe

crackles in his lung exam.  The remainder of his physical exam

was otherwise normal.  Mucus membranes were moist.  Abdomen was

soft.  Extremities had no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.

LABORATORY DATA:  The patient had a normal chest x-ray, negative

urinalysis.  White blood cell count was 7.12.  He had a

creatinine of 1.24, up from his baseline and a lactate of 3.8. 

His chest x-ray showed no acute process.

IMPRESSION:  My impression is that the patient has severe sepsis

by virtue of evidence of change in his mental status and his

creatinine, he was given a liter of normal saline in the

Emergency Department as a bolus.  Given that pneumonia and

urinary tract infection were highest on the list, we decided to

treat him with Rocephin and azithromycin.  He will be admitted to

the Medical Service.

Dyersville, WI  69617


Dear Hicks,


I had the pleasure of seeing Hannah Hendricks in Internal Medicine today.  She was seen alongside my attending, Dr. Heidi Erik-Roy.  As you know, she is a lovely 52-year-old female in whom you have found a left lower extremity bypass surgery.  She comes in today for perioperative risk assessment.  Ms. Hendricks tells me that she has longstanding type 1 diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and peripheral arterial disease.  She in fact has undergone lower extremity bypass grafting in both her left and right lower extremities.  Specifically, she is status post a right fem-pop bypass in 2066 and a left fem-DP bypass also in 2066.  It appears that her right graft has been functioning well, but her left graft was noted to be occluded many years ago.  She comes in now with a nonhealing ulcer and gangrene in her left toe.  You have planned a redo bypass for this upcoming Saturday.


Ms. Hendricks tells me that she has never had any history of coronary artery disease.  She has never had any chest discomfort, shortness of breath, orthopnea, PND, lower extremity edema, palpitations, lightheadedness, or syncope.


She does have a strong family history of coronary artery disease with a brother who had several myocardial infarctions and died at the age of 48 of an MI.  She has a report of a prior EKG with suggestion of an old anteroseptal MI.  She has never had any evaluation for underlying coronary artery disease nor has she had any symptoms referable to CAD.


In terms of her functional capacity, she tells me that up until a year ago, she was doing spinning classes without any chest discomfort or shortness of breath whatsoever.  Because of increasing discomfort in her left lower extremity, she had to reduce her exercise and of late has only been able to do weightlifting without aerobic exercise.  She is however able to climb stairs in her home without any discomfort in her chest or any shortness of breath.  She is unfortunately limited significantly by foot pain.


Her past medical history is as noted above including type 1 diabetes for which she uses an insulin pump, peripheral arterial disease, status post bilateral lower extremity bypass, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia.


Her current medications include aspirin 325 mg, which she started a few days ago, Lipitor 10 mg once daily, Diovan 160 mg twice daily, vitamin C, vitamin B and folic acid supplementation.


She has no clear drug allergies, but does get nauseous and vomiting with Percocet.


She is a past smoker and had smoked for approximately three years, one pack per day in her early 20s.  She works as a Senior Manager of Broadcasting at giant food in Albemarle.


As I mentioned previously, her family history is notable for a brother who died of an MI in his late 40s.


On physical examination, her blood pressure is 135/79, heart rate is 97 and her weight is 137 pounds.  In general, she is very well appearing and in no apparent distress at rest.  She has a jugular venous pressure of approximately 5 cm of water.  She has 2+ carotids with no audible bruits.  Her upper extremities demonstrate 2+ brachial and radial pulses bilaterally.  Her chest is clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Her cardiac exam reveals a regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 and S2, and a soft 2/6 systolic ejection murmur best heard at the left sternal border.  Her abdomen is benign.  She has no abdominal bruits and no significantly palpable aorta.  Her lower extremity exam is notable for a hyperemic left foot with a bandage, which is covering what is reportedly a gangrenous toe.  Her left lower extremity pulses are 1+ in the femoral, absent popliteal and absent distal pulses.  In her right lower extremity, she has 1+ femoral, with no bruit, 2+ popliteal, 2+ DP and 1+ PT.


An EKG done in our clinic today demonstrates a normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 97 beats per minute with a left axis deviation.  There is left atrial enlargement and Q-waves in V1 through V3 suggestive of an old anteroseptal MI.  There are also Q-waves in lead III and aVF, which raises suspicion of an old inferior MI.


In summary, Ms. Hendricks is a lovely 52-year-old female with longstanding diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and peripheral arterial disease who comes in today for perioperative risk assessment in light of an anticipated redo left lower extremity bypass graft.  She appears to have an excellent functional capacity up until several months ago.  However, I am concerned by her electrocardiogram, which raises the suspicion of underlying coronary artery disease given the findings of a probable inferior and old anteroseptal myocardial infarction.  As such, I think that it would be wise to better delineate her burden of coronary artery disease by way of a stress test prior to her surgery.  Given that her functional status has been so good up until recently, I do not think that we need to delay her surgery.  However, I would start her on a beta-blocker and as such, I have given her a prescription for atenolol 25 mg once daily, which she will start today and continue up to and beyond the perioperative period.


During the perioperative period, we would recommend that she has tight control of her blood pressure and heart rate with a goal blood pressure less than 120/80 and a goal heart rate less than 60.  I would also make sure to obtain a postoperative EKG to ensure there has not been any changes.


We will try to arrange for an exercise test with arm ergometry and MIBI imaging for tomorrow morning.  If we are unable to do arm exercise, we will obtain an adenosine MIBI.  I will follow up with the results tomorrow after the study is performed.  As I mentioned because her functional capacity is good, I do not anticipate that we will need to make any changes in the surgical scheduling based on the test results.  This is more in order to give us a sense of the underlying burden of coronary artery disease.


It was a pleasure seeing Ms. Hendricks in clinic today.  We are certainly available during the perioperative period if any cardiovascular issues are to arise.  Please feel free to contact me with any questions.


Sincerely,

RE:  MCKEE, Norma 
MR#: 6987776 
DOB:  7/7/75 
 
Dear Robert, 
 
Thank you for allowing me to share in the medical care of Ms. Norma Mckee, a 51-year-old female patient with the history of seizure disorder, hypertension, borderline diabetes, gastroesophageal reflux disease and panic related symptoms, and depressive disorder, who complains of excessive daytime sleepiness with recent polysomnographic abnormalities.   
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  As you already know, Ms. Mckee describes a longstanding history of snoring symptomatology and suspected nocturnal respiratory pauses, and describes a ""restless sleep"", but only relatively recently (over the last five months, particularly after 12/26 of last year). She has described marked increased daytime sleepiness.  She essentially describes a nocturnal sleep pattern which involves ""sleeping around the clock"" during which time she may initiate sleep between 12:30 and 1:00 a.m., and after a couple awakenings, will wake up at 10:00 a.m., only to demonstrate frequent and often prolonged daytime naps of four hours duration.  The patient states she will waken for a couple of hours and then reinitiate sleep for an additional four hours.  She states that she is so tired that she can ""fall asleep right after breakfast"".  She then would get up for lunch and then go right back to sleep and sustain sleep until 3:00 p.m.  in the afternoon.  
 
Ms. Mckee also demonstrates a history of seizures initiated at 3 to 4 years of age, and was initially started on phenobarbital therapy.  She later switched to Dilantin therapy, but more recently and particularly since the mid 10's, she has been on Tegretol antiepileptic monotherapy 200 mg tablets, four tablets po q.a.m. and three tablets po q.h.s.  While Ms. Mckee also demonstrates both daytime and nocturnal seizures, there has been increased predilections for nocturnal seizures over the last year, and an increased amount of ""diffuse"" spike wave discharges are evident during light sleep, as detailed during a recent polysomnographic evaluation (please see below).  
 
CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Remeron, Celexa, Zestril, Prilosec, carbamazepine (200 mg tablets, four tablets in the morning and three tablets at night), clonazepam, hydrochlorothiazide, Premarin, tetracycline and klor-con.  
 
ALLERGIES:  No adverse drug allergies reported.  
 
SLEEP HISTORY:  Sleep onset intended for 11:00 p.m. but the patient does not often sleep until 12:30 to 1:00 a.m.  She describes one to two early morning awakenings, with relative ease with regards to subsequent reinitiation and maintenance.  Sleep offset initially occurs at 8:30 to 9:00 a.m. and sometimes as late as 10:00 a.m.  The patient will then get up and right after breakfast fall asleep for several hours in duration (up to four hours). The patient then will reawaken and have lunch and then after a couple of hours of sustained wakefulness, will reinitiate sleep for an additional four hours of sleep.  Patient may sleep until 3:00 p.m. on certain given afternoons.  
 
The patient describes a history of prominent snoring symptomatology and suspected nocturnal respiratory pauses as well as ""restless"" sleep.  She denies a history of restless lower limb sensory complaints of nocturnal lower limb movements suggestive of periodic limb movement disorder.  She denies the history of abnormal arousal behaviors or associated narcoleptic symptoms.   
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  
1.   Seizure disorder.  
2.   Hypertension.  
3.   Borderline diabetes.  
4.   Gastroesophageal reflux disease.  
5.   Depressive disorder.  
6.   Panic related symptoms.  
 
SOCIAL HISTORY:  Patient denies active tobacco use.  She has discontinued all alcoholic beverage intake due to her reflux disease.  She averages two cups of tea per day.  While describing an overweight status, she has increased her weight by 10-20 pounds over the past four years.  
 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination, the patient demonstrates a mildly hypersomnolent facies.  Speech is clear and fluent.  Receptive language functioning essentially intact.  No obvious cranial nerve deficits are appreciated.  No focal sensory motor neurologic deficits are noted.  No significant appendicular dystaxias or dysmetrias are currently in evidence. The routine gait appears to be normal based, without evidence of significant gait dystaxias.  No current clinical ictal manifestations are present.  No acute evidence of ""microsleeps"" are noted.   
On HEENT examination, there is evidence of a small posterior oropharyngeal apeture, with increased redundant tissue evident posteriorly and a mildly elongated uvula, as well as a high riding base of the tongue and mildly increased tonsillar size.   
Vital signs include a blood pressure of 144/88 (seated, left arm) and a heart rate of 88, with a respiratory rate of 14.   
IMPRESSION:  
1.   Hypersomnia (780.54):  Likely to be a result of frequent sleep disordered breathing events and their associated arousals.  Other diagnostic possibilities include the presence of gastroesophageal reflux associated arousals as well as nocturnal sleep disruptions due to sleep related epilepsy (although seizures appear to be under relatively good control on Tegretol anticonvulsant monotherapy).  
2.   Obstructive sleep disordered breathing (780.53):  Patient describes a history of prominent snoring symptomatology and nocturnal respiratory pauses as well as extremely frequent intermittent obstructive apneas and a respiratory disturbance index of 26 per hour as noted during a recent 3/26/27 sleep study with associated O2 desaturations down to 76 percent.  Good clinical response to nocturnal CPAP therapy noted.  3.   Seizure disorder:  Recent literature suggests that there is a possible association between treatment of obstructive sleep disorder and increased seizure frequency in patients who are susceptible; i.e., thereby giving a further impetus for regular ongoing home CPAP therapy.  
 
PLAN:  
 
1.   Suggest regular home CPAP administration (CPAP Mallinckrodt; Respironics ""contour classic"" mask; ramp time of 20 minutes; warm air humidification; at 12 cm of water pressure).  
 
2.   Pending clinical response, will reassess the patient's level of alertness, decrease amount of early morning awakenings, and possibly decrease seizure frequency at the next sleep study evaluation in 12-14 weeks times.  
 
3.   In addition, patient is advised to continue efforts at weight reduction, use of an oro-dental, and/or potential ENT surgical approaches may also help to improve upper airway signs and symptoms.  
 
4.   Patient to continue on Tegretol anticonvulsant monotherapy 200 mg tablets, four tablets po q.a.m. and three tablets po q.h.s. until an assessment of seizure frequency with nocturnal CPAP therapy has been made.  
 
5.   Follow up neurologic reevaluation in our sleep study department is tentatively scheduled in 12-14 weeks time.   
Once again, thank you for allowing me to share in the medical care of Ms. Norma Mckee.  I hope this letter finds you in the best of health.  
 
Sincerely, 
 
 
 
Salvador B. Irvin, M.D.  
Department of Sleep Studies 
Houston Medical Center 
 
 
ADDENDUM:  Sleep study results (3/26/27):  
1.   Extremely frequent intermittent obstructive (82) and partially obstructive apneas (63) during supine sleep, as well as intermittent hypopneas (19) and nocturnal hypoventilations, intermittent snore arousals (4) and episodes of moderate snoring (respiratory disturbance index = 26 per hour) with associated arousals and O2 desaturations down to 76%.  Insofar as stage REM sleep was not achieved, the actual degree of respiratory compromise may be under represented.  
 
2.   CPAP administration (CPAP Mallinckrodt; Respironics ""contour classic"" mask; ramp time of 20 minutes; warm air humidification; at 12 cm of water pressure) served to considerably reduce the frequency of these nocturnal respiratory disturbances, help consolidate sleep, as well as improve O2 saturations (i.e., to 96% and above, even during REM supine sleep) and overall sleep stage architecture.  
 
3.   Slightly increased periodic limb movements of sleep, activated during both ""light"" non-REM, as well as stage REM sleep (index = 8 per hour) with infrequent limb associated arousals (index = 1 per hour) both of which may serve to interfere with the continuity of sleep (the presence of REM related nocturnal lower limb movements may suggest some degree of REM motor disinhibition).  
 
4.   Cardiac rates typically ranged between 72-87 beats per minute; average 80 beats per minute.  
 
5.   EEG evidence of frequent bursts and brief runs of ""diffuse"" spike-wave discharges were evident during light sleep, without associated clinical accompaniment.  
 
6.   Inability to achieve stage REM sleep under pre-CPAP conditions, but with prominent ""slow wave and REM rebounds"" subsequently noted with CPAP administration; i.e., accounting for more than 41% and more than 31% of the CPAP sleep times, respectively.  
 
7.   Total recording period:  405 minutes; total sleep time:  377 minutes.

Patient Name: SLATER, OWEN;  MRN: 8635779

Dictated on: 06/14/2138 by URIEL T. ZIRKLE, MD 

 
ATTENDING CONSULTATION NOTE 
 
DIAGNOSIS: Recurrent renal cell carcinoma.  
 
HISTORY: Mr. Slater is a delightful and active 80-year-old man who was incidentally found to have a renal mass in 2133. At that time Dr. Updike performed a left partial nephrectomy, and the final pathology showed a 1.5 cm clear cell renal cell carcinoma. Since that date he has remained well with no clinical evidence of recurrent disease and has had interval CT scans. For the last 2 years, enhancing nodules have been noted within the region of the partial nephrectomy. A biopsy performed approximately 1 year ago did not demonstrate any cancer within modestly enlarged retroperitoneal lymph nodes. CT scan was repeated in December of 2137. This again showed some enlarged retroperitoneal adenopathy and also enlargement of the soft tissue nodules. Biopsy in March of this year showed probable recurrent renal cell carcinoma of the clear cell type within the nodules. Biopsy of an adjacent adrenal gland showed no cancer. His metastatic workup has included CT scans of the chest, which have demonstrated small pulmonary nodules of uncertain significance.  
 
He has met with Drs. Eagle and Yzaguirre. Both have recommended completion of the nephrectomy and resection of any visible tumor, perhaps with intraoperative radiation as well. 
  
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  
 
1. Hypertension.  
 
2. CVA with residual weakness on the right side. He is, however, still able to walk with a cane.  
 
3. High cholesterol.  
 
CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Atenolol, hydrochlorothiazide, lisinopril, Norvasc, Avapro, clonidine, Lipitor, and allopurinol.   

DRUG ALLERGIES: None known.  
 
SOCIAL HISTORY: He is a long retired news writer with a heavy smoking history. He last smoked in 2132. He is a widow and came today to the appointment with 1 of his daughters.  
 
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: No respiratory symptoms suggesting progressive pulmonary metastases, no abdominal or GI symptoms.  
 

PHYSICAL EXAM:
No anemia, jaundice, cyanosis, or clubbing
No gynecomastia
Respiration comfortable
Mild right-sided motor weakness, walks with a cane. 
No skeletal deformity or tenderness
Head, eyes, ears, and nose normal 
Abdomen soft with no hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, nor any additional masses.
No hernias.
 
 
RADIOLOGY: CT scans demonstrate multiple soft tissue nodules within the partial nephrectomy bed, the largest being 15 mm across. He also has prominent lymph nodes within the retroperitoneum, the largest of which is 14 mm, and an enlarged left common iliac lymph node of 18 mm. Chest CT shows scattered 2 mm nodules of uncertain significance.  
 
IMPRESSION AND PLAN: Confirmed local recurrence of renal cell cancer - for completion nephrectomy and resection of tumor bed.  Lymph nodes will be also be sampled.  
 
For intraoperative radiation if appropriate and possibly adjuvant radiation to follow.  Consent obtained today.

RE:  Parrish, Christopher 
SFC#:  553-15-48 
 
Dear Dr. Kirk:  
 
I had the pleasure of seeing your patient, Christopher Parrish, in follow up today.  He is a 71-year-old, right-handed man who was admitted to the Sutton Family Care on December 29, 2088 with left arm weakness, ataxia and dysarthria.  The impression at that time was for lacunar stroke.  An MRI showed a larger area of infarct in the right corona radiata.  The patient had worsening weakness on the night of admission, despite being heparinized.  The following day, he had a flaccid hemiparesis of the left side.  Further workup included a magnetic resonance angiogram that showed irregularity of the proximal middle cerebral arteries bilaterally.  There was no critical carotid stenosis.  He had an embolic workup which consisted of an echocardiogram showing a preserved ejection fraction, dilated left atrium, very mild inferior hypokinesis, and no patent foramen ovale.  He had a Holter monitor which did not reveal any dysrhythmias.  His cholesterol level was 152 with an HDL of 23.  It was felt that his stroke was most likely due to atherosclerosis of the middle cerebral artery, involving either one or possibly several lenticulostriate arteries.  He did not have any evidence of a flow limiting MCA stenosis.  He had been on aspirin prior, Plavix was added to his regimen.   


Since his discharge from the hospital, he has been in rehabilitation for the last two months.  He has had no further episodes of weakness, numbness, tingling, ataxia, dysarthria, or dysphagia.  He has no symptoms of aphasia.  He has been left with some dysarthria from his initial event, which he feels has improved.  I would agree with him.  He also has regained some strength in the left leg, and is currently working on using a walker with assistance.  Unfortunately, he has not regained any use of the left arm.  He has not had any problems with spasms.   


His past medical history is significant for hypertension and type II diabetes mellitus.  He had an inferior myocardial infarction in 2060.  He had a quadruple bypass in 2083.  His last stress test in 2087 showed moderate inferolateral ischemia in the region of a prior myocardial infarct.  He has pulmonary disease due to asbestosis.  He has chronic renal failure and neuropathy secondary to his diabetes.  He has also had laser surgery for diabetic retinopathy.  
 
His medications currently include clonidine .1 mg. p.o. b.i.d., Plavix 75 mg. p.o. q.d., aspirin 325 mg. p.o. q.d., Neurontin 300 mg. p.o. q.h.s., Gemfibrozil 600 mg. p.o. b.i.d., Isordil and Lasix.  He had been on Captopril earlier, but he has since been taken off that medicine.  He was managed with insulin during his prior admission.  I assume he is still on this medicine, although he did not specifically state so.  He has an allergy to sulfa drugs.  
 
The patient lives with a friend who works at Marble Slab Creamery.  The patient quit smoking 15 years ago and only rarely drinks alcohol on social occasions.  There is a history of coronary artery disease in his father and at least one of his brothers, but no family history of stroke.  
 
On examination, he was a pleasant gentleman in no apparent distress.  His blood pressure was 150/90.  His language was intact.  His speech was somewhat dysarthric, although this was improved from his admission.  He was alert and oriented.  His conversation was appropriate.  The visual fields were full.  The pupils were equal and reactive at 4 mm.  Facial sensation was normal.  There was an upper motor neuron left facial droop.  The tongue and palate were midline.  The patient had 0/5 flaccid hemiplegia of the left arm.  There was atrophy of the left biceps.  There was full range of motion of the joints.  The patient had 2/5 left iliopsoas, 4+/5 hip extensors, 3/5 left quadriceps, 3/5 left ankle dorsiflexors, and 3/5 ankle plantar flexors.  The tone in the lower extremities was not increased.  His right side was 5/5.  He had hyperreflexia of the left side and an equivocal toe.  His right toe was downgoing.  Sensation was intact to light touch and pinprick.  I could not find any evidence to pinprick of his neuropathy.  Vibration sense was very mildly reduced at the toes.  He was in a wheelchair, and his gait was not assessed.  
 
Mr. Parrish's recovery is progressing.  He has regained some strength in his left leg and his goal is to be able to walk on his own with either a cane or walker.  I hope that this will be the case.  Unfortunately, his left arm has remained flaccid and he has no movement.  I told him that his left arm will most likely remain with severe weakness.  His stroke was most likely related to atheroma of the middle cerebral artery and lenticulostriate arteries.  I would encourage his blood pressure to be controlled, as has been done, and to continue an anticholesterol agent.  I believe he has been on Gemfibrozil for a while.  The literature suggests benefit for the statin drugs in primary prevention of stroke in patients with elevated cholesterol.  I do not think that gemfibrozil has been studied in the same way.  However, since he has been on this medicine so long, it may be worthwhile to continue using it if it is controlling his total cholesterol well.  He should continue on an aspirin a day.  He states that he is having difficulty obtaining Plavix due to the cost.  I recommended to him that, in the experience of the Stroke Service at Sutton Family Care, patients in his situation do benefit from being on Plavix for a period of time after a stroke of this type.  We recommended to him that he continue on Plavix for another six months because of this.   This should give adequate time for any ulcerated or unstable plaque in his middle cerebral artery to heal.  After six months, if he has had no further clinical events, it would be reasonable to assume that his atheroma is stable and that he could be adequately treated with aspirin.  I will see him again in clinic in approximately six months.  I will arrange for carotid noninvasives and anterior transcranial Dopplers to evaluate his carotid and middle cerebral artery in approximately one year's time.  
 
The patient was seen and examined by Dr. Laith Greene of the Sutton Family Care Stroke Service, who was present for all relevant portions of the history and physical examination.  
 
Sincerely,

NEUROLOGY JUNIOR ADMIT/CONSULT NOTE



CC   slurred speech, L hand tingling



HPI

50 yo RHM  presents after episode of L hand tingling and slurred speech. He was in his usual state of health when he woke up at 8 am. At around 10 am he told his son that he was not feeling well and went to bed. He reports that his speech was normal at that time. At 11:30 his wife called him and his speech was slurred. He was able to say real words but they were slurred and almost unintelligible. He also had L hand tingling. The slurred speech and tingling resolved at 12:15 pm. He denies weakness, diplopia, difficulty swallowing, headache, vertigo, chest pain, palpitations.



One week ago, while he was on vacation in Chincoteague, he had a transient episode of slurred speech. He reports that as he was walking to the bathroom, he suddenly felt lightheaded and fell. He had slurred speech and difficulty standing up but no focal weakness. The episode lasted minutes.

ADMIT DATE:  3/17/78
ATTENDING:  Bell, Charley
Source: Patient and chart


CC:  Diarrhea
HPI: 1M with DM, HTN, HL, and Parkinson's disease.  In 7/77, he had been treated at NAMG for a left lower lobe PNA with levofloxacin, and developed diarrhea while in the hospital.  After discharge, he continued to have profuse diarrhea, and was treated with IV hydration and metronidazole C. diff infection, first found to be positive on 7/31/77.  Since then he has had multiple episodes of recurrent C. diff.   Most recently, he was admitted to NAMG for treatment of recurrent C. diff in 1/77, with improvement after receiving inpatient vancomycin and flagyl, and discharged to NAMG, where he was for 3 weeks.  He received 21 days of flagyl.  After about two weeks, he noticed a gradual increase in his stool frequency.  Three weeks prior to admission, he began taking 500 mg PO Flagyl q8h, which he had at home.  He felt that his symptoms were improved somewhat on the flagyl.  One week ago, he saw his PCP, where a C. diff stool toxin was negative.   At that point, he stopped the PO flagyl, and shortly afterward his diarrhea again progressively worsened.  Currently he is having 10 BM per day, and he states that they are similar to odor, color, and frequency to his prior C. diff episodes.  He has also had a few days of lower abdominal pain, 2-3/10, with no clear pattern, and noticed a few flecks of blood in his stool 2 days ago on one occasion.   He denies other symptoms including fever/chills, n/v, cp, sob, and dizziness. He reports that when he had taken PO vancomycin in the past, it cost $40 per tablet.


ED:  Afebrile, HR 70s.  Hypertensive to 189/82. He was given 1000 cc NS, 5 mg PO amlodipine, 20 mg PO lisinopril, 500 mg IV flagyl.

(1)	Diabetes mellitus: Went on cruise.  Ate frequently but watched portions.  Apparently patient checks blood sugars between 3:00 and 3:00 and when she has shakiness.  She was under the impression that after lunch she had to fast for three hours prior to checking sugar, at which point notes low blood sugars in the 50's to 70's with shakiness, for which she takes a handful of raisins.  Generally eats breakfast at 8:30, lunch 12:00 or 12:30, supper at 5:30.  Snacks in the evening, always apple and yogurt.  Most recently, additionally popcorn and saltine crackers, occasional pretzels.  After takes raisins, shakiness of hypoglycemic symptoms resolve.  While on cruise, patient found that she could actually walk more than she thought she could.  Since she has been home, has not been walking routinely.

(2)	HTN: No chest pain, shortness of breath or palpitations.  

(3)	Back pain/lower extremity pain.  States taking glucosamine chondroitin.  Over the last two or three months, feels that it is helping with decreased pain.  Also has been seen at physical therapy again.  Feels that this is helping.



PE:	Weight down 2 pounds!.  Blood pressure, right arm: 126/68.  Chest is clear.  Cardiac: Regular rhythm at 66, no murmur or gallop.  



A/P:	(1)	Diabetes mellitus: Somewhat better control with mildly elevated morning sugars.  Have asked patient to decrease popcorn and/or crackers at h.s.  Have advised patient to take small handful of raisins prior to onset of hypoglycemic symptoms advised around 2:00 to 2:30 p.m.  Have encouraged patient to continue to walk daily.  Continue current treatment.

(2)	Back pain/lower extremity pain: Some improvement with PT and increased med.  Continue for now.

(3)	HTN: At goal.  Return to clinic at the beginning of November to Dr. Ullom to resume care.

NAME:    Yager, Becky 
MRN:     0887181

Becky returns for follow-up of painful neuropathy.  A lot has happened since she
was seen.  She was terminated at her job working as a Credit Manager in December 2093.  She
therefore has been having financial problems.  She does not have enough money to
buy her medications.  She has a history of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. 
She has not taken these medications for months.  She states she has been taking her
nortriptyline, dilantin and Percocet as previously prescribed.  When I called her from
the waiting room today, she walked towards me, she veered, and I caught her before
she fell.  We then got the wheelchair and wheeled her into the room and history was
taken.  She reports being off balance for about the past month.  She has been feeling
more unsteady on her feet.  She states she has not actually fallen but has come close
to falling.  She denies any true vertigo, ringing in her ears, headaches, change in
mentation, numbness, weakness or change in gait.  On review of other systems, she
reports a 20 lb. weight gain over the past few months which she attributes to not
working and being at home and eating more than usual.  She also notes that she has
begun urinating at night which she previously did not do.  She complains of excessive
dry mouth.  She reports being more thirsty than usual.  

PHYSICAL EXAM:  On exam, she was her usual pleasant self.  She is alert and
oriented X 3.  Speech fluent without aphasia.  BP sitting 145/70.  Pulse 80.  Standing
BP unchanged at 145/70.  Pulse 80.  Cranial nerve exam notable for prominent
bilateral nystagmus.  Otherwise intact.  On motor exam, no tremor or involuntary
movements.  No drift.  Good power throughout.  Fine finger movements intact. 
Vibratory loss to the ankles.  Babinski flexor bilaterally.  

When she got up to stand at the end of the evaluation to leave and telling me she
was fine, she veered to the right and I again caught her.  

IMPRESSION:  Imbalance with history of recently running out of many of her
medications though taking her chronic pain medications as previously prescribed. 
Also notable in the history is new nocturia, increased thirst and dry mouth.  Her
exam is notable for prominent end-gaze nystagmus.  Therefore I suspect toxic
metabolic cause.  As she will need STAT lytes, blood sugar, dilantin level and tox
screen as well as cardiac evaluation, the patient was referred to PROMPTCARE ER.  I will be
in touch with the physicians after they see her.

                           OFFICE NOTE
 
Chandler, Jessica
MRN #748-80-38-0
May 05, 2069
 
Ms. Chandler returns today for a follow-up status post her coronary
artery bypass surgery on 4/1/69.  Since the surgery she has done
quite well.  She was in Sibley Care Center from 4/08 to
4/22/69 and had undergone physical therapy, occupational therapy
and also education on dietary modification.  During her hospital
course she had a repeat echocardiogram which revealed a left
ventricular ejection fraction of 50% and hypokinesis of the septal
wall with mild to moderate pulmonary artery hypertension.  She was
started on lisinopril to help prevent diabetic nephropathy.  She
also received two units of packed red blood cells at her stay at
Sibley Care as it was noted that her hematocrit was only 24. 
She was also briefly treated with Epogen and it was felt that her
renal dysfunction may have been the cause of her low hematocrit. 
Her renal function has improved considerably since stopping
diuretics.  
 
Since going home from Sibley Care, she is starting to walk more
with assistance from a physical therapist around the house.  She is
not experiencing any exertional chest pressure, pain or shortness
of breath.  She also mentions she is currently going to a Diabetes
Support Group tomorrow and plans to get some psychotherapy through
Northern Illinois Medical Center later next month.
 
Medications:  Her current medications are aspirin 81 mg. p.o. q.d.,
lisinopril, increased to 20 p.o. daily today, Coumadin 5 p.o. q.d.,
Kayexalate 15 p.o. q. day, albuterol metered dose inhaler 4 puffs
q.i.d., Azmacort 4 puffs b.i.d., Lasix 40 p.o. q. day, Nephrocaps
one tablet p.o. q. day, NPH Insulin 75 units q. a.m. and 60 units
subcu q. p.m., Prilosec 20 p.o. q.d., Paxil 30 mg. p.o. q. day and
CPAP 8 centimeters water plus 2 liters O2 q. h.s.  
 
Physical Examination:  On physical examination her weight is 326
pounds.   Her blood pressure is 150/110, on repeat per M.D.
150/100, pulse is 80.  Her skin is without any rashes or
ecchymoses, or suspicious nevi present.  Heart regular rhythm,
distant heart sounds with positive S1 and S2.  Her lungs are clear,
there is no sternal instability and the sternal wound is well
healed.  Her extremities are without any edema.  
 
Her O2 sat on room air is 98%.  
 
Diagnosis:
 
1)   Coronary artery disease status post bypass surgery 4/1/69.
2)   Chronic renal insufficiency.Chandler, Jessica
MRN #748-80-38-0

3)   Diabetes mellitus.
 
4)   Anemia of chronic disease.    
 
5)   Obstructive sleep apnea.  
 
6)   Intermittent problems with hyperkalemia.  
 
7)   Hypertension.
 
8)   Morbid obesity.
 
Plan:
 
1)   Coronary artery disease status post CABG.  She is clinically
     doing quite well without any signs of congestive heart failure
     or angina.  Her ejection fraction significantly improved
     postoperatively.  I am concerned about a relatively high blood
     pressure and the visiting nurses have reported that it has
     been going up into the 180s systolic with ambulation.  I will
     increase her lisinopril from 10 to 20 mg. with a careful watch
     of her potassium.  
 
2)   Chronic renal insufficiency.  Again we'll check regular labs
     once to twice weekly monitoring renal function.  
 
3)   Diabetes mellitus.  Stable.  Her blood pressure have been
     under fairly good control.  She has also lost a significant
     amount of weight over 20 pounds.  Her current weight is 326
     pounds.  We'll check hemoglobin A1 with next blood draw.
 
4)   Anemia of chronic disease.  We'll also recheck her blood count
     and follow-up.
 
5)   Obstructive sleep apnea.  The patient is using her CPAP
     machine at night time and I've encouraged her to do so.
 
6)   Hyperkalemia.  She will continue with the Kayexalate as
     prescribed and also we'll continue to monitor her potassium
     regularly over the next several months until they normalize.
 
7)   Morbid obesity.  She is making good progress with her weight
     loss.  She is going to continue on an out-patient program once
     weekly and she is also going to be going for some mental
     health counseling as well which will hopefully continue her on
     a successful weight loss plan.Chandler, Jessica

SOURCE: patient and records



CC/ID: cough



HPI

Mr Gillespie is a 53 yo man with a history of NIDDM and hypertension who presented to House Of Calvary Hospital today with a chief complaint of cough for the last 5 days.  He was in his usual state of health prior to that.  Cough has been dry; also notes shortness of breath with exertion and diaphoresis.  He notes intermittent palpitations and mild lightheadedness during the last few days.  He has had pneumonia several times in the past.  He denies fever, chills, SOB at rest, orthopnea, PND, chest pain, wheezing, hemoptysis, and sick contacts.   He reports compliance with his medications and no recent change in diet.  At Calvary, CXR was interpreted as bilateral pneumonia L&gt;R.  EKG revealed atrial fibrillation, of which he had no known history.  He was referred to the GRH ED for further evaluation.



In the ED he was afebrile, HR 130s-140s (atrial fibrillation)  SBP 140s  O2 sat 99-100%.  On exam he had fine bibasilar crackles.  He was given levofloxacin 750 mg po, dalteparin 5000 units, diltiazem 10 mg iv and 30 mg po with lowering of HR to 90s, and NS 500 cc.  He was admitted to Medicine &#8211; Mediquik 77 for further management.

INTERNAL MEDICINE ASSOCIATES

HOLDEN DISTRICT HOSPITAL



Reason for visit

			

  Followup of recent MI and multiple medical problems.



History of present illness

			

  Since the patient's last visit, he developed a maculopapular rash and his Plavix was discontinued.  Since this is the only new medication, it was presumed that Plavix was the cause of the new skin rash.  He also changed his beta blocker and started Toprol XL approximately one week ago.  At home, he states his pulse has been under better control, and now, is in the 60 range.  He denies any palpitations, PND, orthopnea, or shortness of breath.  He has had no recurrent angina and has tried this week to slowly start to walk for about 15 minutes on his treadmill at a low pace.  He has not had any angina or chest pain with this walking routine.  He also knows that his sugars at home had been very low at 55 and 56 in the evening.  He has had weight loss and slightly diminished appetite and this may account for his low blood sugars.  He is here for a followup.  Of note, his Bumex dose was decreased due to an elevated BUN and creatinine.  His weight has been stabled, and he feels better on the lower dose of diuretics without symptoms of congestive heart failure.



Major Problems





Coronary artery disease

see HPI



Atrial fibrillation

Rx with rate control, and coumadin. rate 60,s at home. No CHF, neuro Sx



Hypertension

Review of systems

			

  The patient has had no fevers, chills, or night sweats. No cough. He has chronic nasal congestion .  He has no sputum production.  No joint symptoms, GI, GU, or neurological complaints.  No skin rashes.



Physical examination

Blood pressure 110/60

Musc skel   No bony deformities.

Neuro   Grossly nonfocal.  Speech fluent without paraphasic errors. Memory, excellent and intact.  Gait normal

Preventive eye exam   5/92



Assessment and plan

			

  The patient's multiple issues were reviewed with the patient in detail.  His weight has remained fairly stable on the lower dose of diuretics, and a repeat BUN and creatinine were sent today.  He was volume depleted at his last visit.  Currently, he has no symptoms of unstable angina and no evidence of congestive heart failure on exam.  His blood sugars have been low, and therefore, he will hold his glyburide for now.  His pulse remained somewhat elevated, and he will follow up with his cardiologist relative to the need for cardioversion for an attempt to get him back into normal sinus rhythm.  His weight control has been a problem.  He will slowly increase his ambulation and will check his pulse and blood pressure at home.  He will follow up here in two months or sooner if needed.

EKG: NSR, prolonged QT-no change from prior-non specific ST/T wave abnormalities



CT Head-1.  No intracranial hemorrhage or CT evidence of acute stroke

	though MRI diffusion weighted imaging would be more sensitive.

	2. Stable encephalomalacia and Wallerian degeneration from left

	MCA stroke.

	3. Prior left pterional craniotomy and left MCA aneurysm 

      clipping.





Assessment/Plan:

1.	 Seizures-likely in setting of subtherapuetic Dilantin dose-will finish one gram load and start PO dilantin in am at 300 tid per neurology recommendations and check levels and await levels 10-15. Head CT negative for new process and no evidence of other reason for seizure. Patient on Keppra in past-needed now? Will ask neurology

2.	Pyuria-uncertian if significant due to the patient's likely minimal urine output-sent for culture-will await results-continue broad specrtrum coverage of potential pathogens with Vancomycin (1 gram given in ED) and ceftriaxone.

3.	High WBC-Abd CT reportedly negative as was CXR-will check final results and patient without symptoms-blood cultures pending-follow temp curve and WBC and continue abx until cultures negative

4.	Electrolyte abnormalities-patient on hemodialysis-will schedule for am-if not possible will have to treat for hyperkalemia.

5.	Renal transplant-continue Prednisone

6.	CVA-Will continue Aggrenox for now

7.	Other-continue home meds for now except lactobacillus as certain of purpose?

Booked for CPE, but current symptoms took precedence.  



Pt presents very discouraged over escalating Lasix doses and persistant problems with reccurent edema and cough, each time relieved by increasing diuretics, so ACEI cough seems unlikely.  Avoiding all salt in diet with good compliance.  Did see sleep lab tech, tried new settings and mask on new machine, but still tolerates poorly.  When discussed in some detail, notes feelings of suffocation with wearing mask for any period of time.  Also notes sense of being tied down frrom mask very difficult to tolerate.  Without exploring details greatly, we discussed potential role of PTSD in precipitating symptoms related to mask use, and potentially  the effect of nocturnal hypoxia and RV strain on accumulation of fluid.  Improving tolerance of CPAP seems very key.  Pt has started atkins dt with good success (6# in first week), and improving BGs are requiring reduction in insulin, which is great.  so it seems that addressing OSA is the key to improving overall status now.  We discussed some options...Including potential for tracheostomy to fix this without having to address mask, but agreed to try to initiate trial of CBT to see if we can improve mask talerance with symptom reduction.  He remains quite clear that he has no interest in furhter ""exploring"" the PTSD history, and I reassured him that CBT does not require doing this.  



OSA:  Likely has near optimal mask set up now...We'll explore potential for CBT with sleep center or perhaps cardiac rehab source.  Hopefully this would address fluid imbalance to a greater extent as well.  



DM:  improving with wt loss and diet.  Agree with insulin taper as sugars drop.  UAMLB high but < 1 year ago, recheck in future.  Creatinine stable 2 months ago, recheck renal panel with labs.  Optho and podiatry current.  



Lipids: last LDL was an outlier..Has slip fro repeat FLP.

well controlled.  



Peripheral vascular disease : claudication limited Sx with limited exercise tolerance.  



Obesity :  adtkins dt as above.  



Glaucoma : Dr. Russo, HWS, gets regular f/u.  



Insomnia : since service. NTI helped a little in past, not after a while. CBT might help if successful.  



Reviewed HM, mostly up to date, should get Td update at some point or if wound, counseled.  



Most of 40 minute visit counseling on CBT, PTSD, sleep apnea, and concern about failing regimen.  

Emailed Barbara Fierro, Sleep center, Dr. Yeargin, and Dr. Ingham of Rehab to help identify best CBT practitioner for this.

			CARDIOLOGY

			

			ELKHORN VALLEY CLINIC

			



			Reason for visit:

   A 59 yr old IDDM man  s/p CABG in 25 with IDDM and CHF admitted after elective cardiac cath which revealed new RCA occlusion for post hydration/Mucomyst/bicarb.



			Interval History:

   Cardiac history began in 2125 with inappropriate sinus tachycardia. A cardiac echo revealed EF of 64% with no valvular disease and normal wall motion. An Aden MIBI 4/25 revealed inferior and PL ischemia and he was taken to the cath lab. The cath revealed mild pulmonary hypertension, PCW of 14, co-dominance with 65% PDA, moderate LCX disease and severe proximal LAD lesion. HE subsequently underwent CABG with LIMA to LAD, radial artery to LCX and VG to PDA. 1/26 he noted progressive DOE with upper chest discomfort and was brought to the cath lab. His PA pressure was 45/20 with a PCW of 20, all grafts were open and his BB and lasix were increased.

An Aden MIBI 12/27 showed an EF of 60% w small PB scar & inferior-lateral ischemia. Echo 2/28 revealed new LA enlargement with EF of 62%. He was admitted 1/29 with HF exacerbation/acute renal failure in the setting of rapid out-patient diureses with zaroxolyn.  (BUN 74, creat 2.2) Diuretics as well as Glucophage and ACE I were held and he was discharged with a creat of 1.2. An echo revealed new mild MR and RF of 59%. 

Over the last few months he has noted episodes of sudden lightheadedness/dizziness, floaters. He would take his BP with a home machine and it could be as low as 77/47. In addition, he has noted progressive DOE as well an now rest angina that is requiring a SL TNG for relief. He has 3 flights of stairs to climb to his apartment and uses 1 SL TNG prophylactically.  

An exercise adenosine MIBI was done 6/14 which revealed an EF of 75% with mild anterior  and IPL ischemia. He was admitted for a cardiac cath 6/20, however due to a creatinine of 2.4 only a right heart cath was done. It revealed  RAP of 7, RVP of 36/17, PAP of 35/17, PCW of 17 and CO 5.9.

Given his episodes of sudden hypotension as well as increasing creatinine, Diltiazem as well as Ramipril and Aldactone have been held. He reports no further episodes of hypotension since stopping these meds.

He is being followed by Dr You in renal service.

Of note, he continues to use the oxygen at night.(2 liters NP)



Cardiac cath today revealed normal LM, TO mid LAD with LIMA to LAD filling distal LAD, mild LCX disease, RCA is totally occluded with distal vessel filling via VG to RPDA, VG to RCA small vessel but patent, LIMA to LAD patent. Althought the RA graft to the PDA and VG to LCX are patent - they are small and atretic.

ENT-Sclera were white, fundi disc sharp, conjunctiva clear, tympanic membranes normal, ear canal AS somewhat red. The oropharynx was pink without exudate. The neck was supple with out adenopathy. 

LUNG- clear bilaterally, without rhonci, wheeze or rales, Normal excursion was noted. 

Cor- heart rate was normal, rhythm was regular. No murmurs, gallops or rubs were detected 

Extremities: no clubbing cyanosis or edema. 

Skin- no abnormal lesions noted.







Impression

Ear- benign exam but symptomatic - try cortisporun otic

 

HTN- very high, no sign of end organ injury at this moment- will increase atenolol to 100, and have her rtc for recheck.  It would be helpful to know whether cramps came from hctz or amilodipine.

RE:  Shilpa Pickett
     MR #129-53-47-3
 
Dear Philip:
 
I had the pleasure of seeing Shilpa Pickett in Cardiovascular
Clinic today.  Since her discharge from the hospital in September,
she has noticed that she is fatigue with exertion but has had no
chest pressure and no exertional diaphoresis, nausea, or jaw pain. 
She does note occasional lightheadedness throughout the day, this
is not related to position or going from sitting to standing
position.  As you are aware, her MIBI test showed very small amount
of ischemia almost undetectable in amount.  
 
Her medical regimen includes Lasix 40 mg po q.d., Lisinopril 20 mg
po q.d., 125 mg of hydrochlorothiazide b.i.d.  Of note, she was
taking an additional Lisinopril at 20 mg po b.i.d.  Labetalol 200
mg b.i.d., Isordil 40 t.i.d., Prilosec 20 mg po q.d., Cisapride 10
mg po q.d., simvastatin 10 mg po q.d., aspirin 325 mg po q.d.
 
On physical exam, her blood pressure is 140/90 right and left arm
seated, heart rate is 77 and irregular, respiratory rate is 12. 
There is no increase in jugular venous pressure.  Carotids are free
of bruits.  Lungs are clear to auscultation throughout.  Cardiac
exam is notable for distant heart sounds with no S3, S4.  Abdomen
is soft and nontender.  The extremities are free of edema.  
 
Electrocardiogram is normal sinus rhythm with left bundle branch
block unchanged from prior electrocardiograms.
 
In summary, Shilpa Pickett certainly has cardiovascular risk
factors of sedentary lifestyle, diabetes, high cholesterol and
increase in weight.  We will be rechecking her lipid profile today. 
She reports to me that she has absolutely no appetite for the foods
she usually eats and has occasionally had trouble eating.  She
notes no dysphoria and no other signs or symptoms of depression. 
She has had no change in her hair or skin.  For the 
 
 
Pickett, Shilpa
MR #129-53-47-3               -2-            October 13, 2061
 
moment, I will be reviewing her SMA 20 for evidence of liver
dysfunction but would strongly consider both depression and
hyperthyroidism for further workup of this loss of appetite.  
 
It is certainly a pleasure for me to participate in Shilpa
Pickett' care.  Let me know if there are any questions or issues I
can be of help with.
 
Sincerely,

(665) 578-7821                     03/06/2087


CHIEF COMPLAINT:  The patient is a 75-year-old woman, new patient who comes in to establish primary care and for followup of multiple medical problems including end-stage renal disease, hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, history of foot drop, etc.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  End-stage renal disease.  Because of her original end-stage renal disease was reportedly FSGS, she had a preemptive transplant in 2068, which was complicated by rejection and ultimate loss of the graft.  She resumed dialysis in 2072.  She had a second transplant in 2075, which was also complicated and ultimately rejected.  She resumed hemodialysis in 2082.  She does have a match with her only daughter, but apparently the Transplant Service feels that she would not be a good candidate and I think she would be reluctant to go through two surgeries, which would be required, one to remove the old graft and one for the new transplant.  She currently is dialyzed at the Overbrook Hospital.  Her dialysis physician is Dr. Lemus.
2.  Hypertension.
3.  Peripheral vascular disease.  She had an angiogram in 2083 at LMC and an MRA in 2085, which showed bilateral iliac and femoral artery stenoses.  She apparently does not have claudication despite this.
4.  History of right foot-drop.  She had a severe episode of shingles in 2077 with associated sciatica and foot-drop.
5.  History of hemorrhoids for at least six years with occasional bleeding and with anal protrusion.
6.  History of CMV colitis in 08/2081.
7.  Secondary hyperparathyroidism.  She is on Sensipar and has been on this since early 2085.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  She had a supracervical hysterectomy for benign disease in 2061 and a left salpingo-oophorectomy for a serous cyst in 04/2082.  She is status post appendectomy.  She is status post bilateral cataract surgery.

MEDICATIONS:  Norvasc 10 mg per day, lisinopril 20 mg per day, metoprolol 50 mg b.i.d., Lipitor 40 mg per day, aspirin 81 mg per day, Nephrocaps 1 mg per day, Restoril 15 mg nightly, Hectorol 4 mcg per 2 mL three times per week, B6 200 mg per day, vitamin E 400 mg per day, flaxseed oil 1000 mg per day and B12 4000 mcg per day.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Significant for diabetes in her father and grandfather, negative for cancer.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She is a widow.  She is a lifetime nonsmoker.  She does not drink alcohol or use drugs.  She is a retired mathematician at Vassar.  She came from Turlock 10 years ago to Pecos to be with her daughter who is a surgeon in the area.  She never has felt the Pecos as home and is home sick for Turlock.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  She has had some problems with left shoulder pain and immobility.  She generally seems to be somewhat overwhelmed and a little bit sad.  She seems never to have adjusted to life in Pecos.  She has had the loss of two the kidney transplants and then the foot-drop, which has made walking difficult.  She did have a brace at one time, which helped her to walk, but it was irritating.  She had seen Dr. Yim to get another one, but that never worked out.  She did not complain of any chest pain or shortness of breath, no constipation.  She does have hemorrhoids that are active as above.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She is a well-developed, well-nourished, very pleasant, but somewhat sad-appearing white female.  Her blood pressure is 140/60.  HEENT, pupils equal, round and reactive to light.  Extraocular movements are intact.  Throat is clear.  Neck, supple, no adenopathy or thyromegaly.  Heart, regular rate and rhythm.  Lungs, clear.  Abdomen, soft, nontender, no organomegaly.  Extremities, no edema.  Neuro, absent reflex in the right patella and 2+ in the left patella.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
1.  End-stage renal disease on dialysis, not considered to be a transplant candidate at this time as she has had two rejections.
2.  Hypertension, well controlled on medications.
3.  Hyperlipidemia, on Lipitor.  Last cholesterol was checked in 10/2086 with normal ALT and AST, but elevated alkaline phosphatase.
4.  Peripheral vascular disease, currently asymptomatic.
5.  Right foot-drop.  We may look into getting her another brace perhaps another consult with Dr. Yim.
6.  Left shoulder pain.  It did mention in her physical, but she can only abduct her left shoulder to about 90 degrees without pain.  We may look into this further and perhaps get some physical therapy for possible rotator cuff tendinitis.
7.  Hemorrhoids.
8.  Secondary hyperparathyroidism on Sensipar.
9.  Health maintenance.  Mammogram was done in 06/2086.  Pap smear was done in 04/2083.  Colonoscopy was done in 08/2081.
10.  ? Depression.  She seemed a little sad.  Has had a tough time with her medical problems and never adjusted that well to Pecos.  Will have her come back and discuss further.

Medicine Attending Admit Note


June 9, 2084 
1340 h


I interviewed and examined the patient on rounds this morning with Dr. Lilly and with Team E and we reviewed the relevant data and discussed the case in detail.  I agree with the findings and recommendations in Dr. Lilly's note, with any small exceptions or points of emphasis noted below.  Please refer to it for details of HPI, PMH, medications and allergies, family and social history, laboratory and other data, and ROS.  I would only add/emphasize the following:



Mr. Gillespie is a 53 year-old man with medical history that includes: 

h/p Hodgkin&#8217;s lymphoma, 2070-2071, treated with local resection, bleomycin, adriamycin, and other agents, XRT to a wide chest field 
Atrial fibrillation - diagnosed in 3/84; on warfarin, metoprolol 
Pectus excavatum &#8211; repair failed as a child 
Pneumonia several times in the past 
Central obesity &#8211; weighs about 315#, down from a high of 360# 
Type II diabetes mellitus, last A1C 6.4, on metformin only, 1000 mg BID 
Hypertension, on lisinopril 10 mg, Toprol XL 
Elevated lipids - on statin 
Neurofibromatosis (Soft tissue mass in right apex noted on 3/84 CT may be neurogenic tumor.) 
Kidney stones 
Patent foramen ovale


He presents with dyspnea, orthopnea, and palpitations as described by Dr. Lilly, and was found to be in atrial fibrillation/flutter with rapid ventricular response.  He has improved with heart rate control.  


Exam
VS - as noted
General - pleasant obese white man with severe pectus deformity.  Breathing with abdominal muscles tensed on expiration.  
CV - heart with regular rhythm, normal S1, prominent S2, and no murmurs, rubs, or gallops
Lungs - clear
Abdomen - obese
Extremities - minimal edema


Data  - reviewed in detail and are as in Dr. Lilly's note.  Bicarb 31, BNP 2050, WBC 15, INR 3.1.




Impression:  Poorly tolerated atrial fibrillation/flutter with RVR, needing better rate control.  Given the severe pectus deformity as well as his history of lung-toxic chemotherapy drugs and XRT, he may have some restrictive lung disease that would limit his cardiopulmonary reserve.  I would not be surprised if he additionally has obstructive lung disease, given the ""belly breathing"" and the wheezing he had last admission.  


Recommendations:  

Increase metoprolol dose.  May need Toprol XL 100 BID.  Best to maximize utility of BB prior to adding other agents.

Filter all IVs (PFO)
PFTs and Pulmonology consult as an outpatient
Balance of plan per Dr. Lilly.

NAME:     Yager, Rebecca 

MRN:      0887181 



FOLLOW-UP VISIT  



Patient returns for follow-up of painful neuropathy.  



Since last seen, her Dilantin level came back at 18.8.  She feels her pain has been

under relatively good control.  She has had a few falls since she was last seen all

due to losing her balance or tripping.  No lightheadedness or vertigo preceding her

falls.  She is trying to be more careful to avoid future falls by watching closely

where she is walking.  



She has no active infection at present.  She is scheduled for follow-up EMG nerve

conduction studies in January.  



ON EXAM:  She is her usual pleasant self.  Examination of the feet shows

hammertoes, numerous bunions, some reddened calluses but no ulcers or open

lesions.  There is vibratory loss to the ankles and absent ankle jerks bilaterally.  



IMPRESSION:  Painful neuropathy with 10-year history of progressive symptoms. 

Numerous previous work-ups for reversible causes of neuropathy have been

negative.  I would like to have her be evaluated by Dr. Phyllis Brewer of

Internal Medicine to see if she has any other ideas as to any additional work-up

or treatment.  Of note, previously had a DENA panel for sensory neuropathy

which was negative.  Rebecca was given a new prescription for Percocet #100.  I will

see her in follow-up in two months.

	Interval History:
   Mr. Crawford returns to the clinic for routine scheduled follow-up.  His cardiovascular issues include prior syncope, nonobstructive coronary disease, and hypertension. In the interval, since our last visit, he has done well from a CV perspective. He has had no episodes of chest pain, pressure, tightness, orthopnea, PND, progressive lower extremity swelling, or claudication. He did unfortunately have an episode of diverticulosis requiring hospitalization at Oakcrest Nursing Home. He did not require transfusion. The bleeding sounds as though it was self-limiting and has not recurred. Otherwise, his health is unchanged.  He remains fairly limited due to his osteoarthritis but continues to perform all ADLs successfully.

	

	Changes to Allergies
	
BRIMONIDINE TARTRATE - reaction: Unknown [reviewed]
Latex - reaction: Rash [reviewed]
no known allergies: He has no current allergies - reaction: Unknown [reviewed]

Physical examination:
	
-Pulse:   50, which is strong and regular
-resp. rate:   12.  He is saturating 100% at room air
-Extremities:   There is trace dependent 1+ lower extremity swelling, which is stable.
-Abdomen:   Soft and nontender.
-Cardiac:   Regular with nondisplaced PMI, 1-2/6 systolic ejection murmur heard best at the base with the crisp S2.
-Chest:   His lungs are clear.
-Neck:   Jugular venous pressure is 7 cm of water with normal AV contour.  He has 2+ carotids with brisk upstrokes.
-Heent:   Normocephalic.
-General:   He is alert and appropriate in no apparent distress
-BP: 138/72    in the right arm seated


	EKG:
   Sinus bradycardia at 50. Delayed R-wave progression. Leftward axis. Nonspecific ST-T wave abnormalities.

Selected recent labs:
	
		
	


	Impression:
   1.) Nonobstructive CAD
2.) Neurocardiogenic syncope
3.) Hypertension


	Assessment and plan:
   Overall he is doing well his cardiovascular issues are stable.  His blood pressure slightly above goal but given his past syncopal tendencies with aggressive lowering will hold off on any med changes for now.  I will see him back in six months, sooner if new issues arise.

Personal Data and Overall Health	

75-year-old S/P L internal capsule stroke 6/32.



Reason for Visit	

Mr. Slater returns to clinic today for routine follow up. I last saw him on 10/1/2132, and he has continued to improvesince that time. He remains on ASA 325mg po qd for stroke prevention, and continues to be worked up for renovascular hypertension. He has had no new stroke-like symptoms, and only very infrequently feels that the right leg is weak, usually at the end of the day when he is fatigued. He was recently seen by Dr. Harry Tolliver of the department of Cardiology. He underwent a 24-hour holter monitor, which showed no evidence for atrial fibrillation or other significant dysrhythmia. His CNIS have no evidence for disease. He is to go for his TTE with bubble study later today.



Medications	  

PROPRANOLOL (PROPRANOLOL HCL)	 40MG PO BID x 87 days Start Date: 10/1/32 Stop Date: 12/27/32

ATENOLOL	 50MG 1 Tablet(s) PO QD Start Date: 12/31/32

NORVASC (AMLODIPINE)	 2.5MG 1 Tablet(s) PO QD Start Date: 12/31/32



Exam	

Alert, Ox3. Speech fluent, non-dysarthric. 

EOM's full, no nystagmus. 

Face symmetric, full power x 4. No drift. 

Gait steady, narrow-based. 



Plan	

I am pleased with his negative results so far (24 hour holter, CNIS), and I doubt the TTE will change our management. We are likely left with small vessel disease causing a lacune in the internal capsule. The best for of treatment would be continued antiplatelet therapy with the ASA 325mg per day, and continued treatment for his hypertension, as per Dr. Tolliver. I will see him again in 3 months time, and he will call me in the interim with any problems or questions.

	Reason for visit:
   s/p Left SFA intervention 


	Interval History:
   Mr . Yusuf is a 64 y.o. male who presented to Dr Barton's office on 6/18/79  with left foot pain with claudication at approximately 20 feet, L&gt;R, and constant left great toe pain. He has intermittent b/l buttock. Found it difficult to walk from the entrance to the Cath lab today. He describes upon awakening with paresthesias which resolves with ambulation. He does not exercise but is active during the day. 

He also c/o chest discomfort starting last week with palpitations associated with lightheaded. He was resting at the time. He took sl TNG without any improvement. This has occured 2-3 times. He denies sob, n/v, diaphoresis, syncope. 

CTA RUN on 6/03/79 showed multilevel disease involving both SFAs. Right focal area of mild to moderate ISR. Left severe focal stenosis of the SFA proximal to the proximal stent and severe focal in-stent stenosis within the distal stent. One vessel runoff bilaterally via the peroneal arteries. AVF in the right groin. 

An Adenosine MIBI was performed on 6/03/79. Exercised with arm exercises for  4' 0"", reaching 62% of MPHR. EKG negative for ischemia. Images show small territory of mild septal ischemia, EF 46%. Compared to 10/78 (done w/ exercise as opposed to adenosine) the anterior and apical ischemia is no longer evident and the EF is similar 49%. 

Today he underwent coronary angiography which revealed no change from prior cath. Peripheral angiogram noted aorta and renal arteries were patent. Left and right common and external iliac arteries patent. Stent at the origin of the right ext iliac had a 30% diffuse narrowing. Bilateral internal iliac arteries have moderately severe stenoses in the distal aspect of main branches. The left SFA has two areas of tapered stenosis up to 70% one is proximal and the other is midvessel; main popliteal is patent, but focal 75% stenosis present at distal portion prior to trifurcation. Anterior and posterial tibial vessels occluded and reconstitute at the ankle by collaterals from the peroneal. The peroneal has calcified 60% diffuse disease in the proximal segment. He therefore underwent PTA of the proximal SFA, PTA and stent to the mid SFA, DCA and PTA of distal popliteal lesion, fox hollow and PTA of proximal peroneal stenosis. He is presently being admitted to Cardiology post intervention.


	Past medical history:
   1. Coronary artery disease. Cath 11/78 showed 3 vessel CAD with involvement of distal coronary circulation. All vessels  narrow in caliber. LM distal 30%, LAD diffuse proximal plaque and occluded after large diagonal. Faint collaterals supply distal LAD and septals,. Diagonal patent, Lcx 50% ostial stenosis  then 50-60% irregular stenosis in proximal aspect of AV groove artery after OM1 take off. OM1 patent. Diffuse plaquing in Lcx and Om. RCA diffuse plaquing in dominant vessel, narrow up to 35%. EF 65% with mild apical HK.

2. PVD: 
Stent to right external iliac, 30% narrowing. 
PTA to SFA, stent to mid SFA, directional arthrectomy and PTA of distal popliteal lesion, fox hollow PTA or proximal peroneal stenosis. Angiogram 11/78: 
Peripheral artery disease. Aroto iliac vessels patent. Left Common iliac 40% plaque distally. Left  internal iliac patetn, left external iliac patent, left CFA calcified plaque w/ 40% stenosis. Left SFA 40% focal proximal, then 50-60% mid and 70% stenosis proximal to and into prior. Adductor canal stent, 70% at egress of stent. Left popliteal patent. Peroneal patent but AT and PT occluded. TPT 70% tapered. Right common and external iliacs patent, internal iliac distal stenosis of 60-70% at complex trifurcation. Right CFA narrowed 50% by plaque. Right SFA and popliteal diffuse plaque deposition, patent. Cryoplasty balloon angioplastyof left distal  (within and above prior stent) and mid SFA. Stent  7 x 30 mm Precise in distal SFA overlapping w/ proximal aspect of prior stent, 7 x 20 mm Exceed in mid SFA in site of Cryoplasty where there remained a narrowing and dissection. Post dilation of both sites  with balloon. PTA and stent 2.5 x 28 Cypher in TP trunk. Widely patent to ankle. Patent renal arteries
3. Hypertension.
4. Hyperlipidemia.
5. Type 2 diabetes.
6. Left ulnar transposition and left ulnar nerve compression, with prior surgery on 07/26/2078.
7. Ulcerative colitis diagnosed 30 years ago, on medication for a short time. Episode 10-15 years ago controlled with meds. In the last 2 years he has had increased problems and has been hospitalized. He has never had surgery. His last colonosocpy was 3 months  ago. 
8. GERD.
9. Gout
10.Depression-  never hospitalized. See Psychiatrist.

EDVISIT^32612454^Barr, Nicky^01/13/93^IP, CARRIE

I saw this patient in conjunction with Dr. Xue.  I confirm

that I have interviewed and examined the patient, reviewed the

resident's documentation on the patient's chart, and discussed

the evaluation, plan of care, and disposition with the patient.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  A 57-year-old with back pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a young woman with a

complicated past medical history, presents with a chronic history

of low back pain, worse over the last week.  She states that 3

years ago, she had a motor vehicle accident.  Since that time,

has had chronic low back pain.  She has been able to ambulate at

home.  Denies any fevers, rashes, history of urinary

incontinence, weakness, or numbness.  She went to EDUCARE-FARGO earlier

this week and was prescribed Percocet, comes here now because the

patient's family and the patient would like to change her care to

Lansing Dover Clinic.  Denies any numbness or weakness. 

States that she is no longer taking her pills at home.  Denies

any suicidal or homicidal ideation, has a flat affect.  Denies

any depression.  Her son, however, with whom she lives disagrees

and is very concerned that she may be depressed.  He is also very

concerned that she is not taking her medicines and that she is

not caring for herself well at home.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Remarkable for hypertension, diabetes, and

a prior stroke.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  She has also had knee surgery.

SOCIAL HISTORY, FAMILY HISTORY, AND REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  As per

the written note.  The patient was counseled regarding smoking

cessation.

MEDICATIONS:  Hydrochlorothiazide and Coumadin.

ALLERGIES:  None.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient is awake and alert in no acute

distress.  Vital signs are within normal limits as documented. 

For full physical exam findings, please see the resident's

written note.  Specifically, HEENT, neck, respiratory, cardiac,

rectal, and abdominal exam are within normal limits as

documented.  Skin exam is remarkable for erythematous changes in

the groin where the patient has significant skin fold due to

obesity.  Musculoskeletal exam is otherwise unremarkable.  Range

of motion is full.  Strength and tone is normal.  The patient

does have a positive straight leg raise on the left, reproducing

her back pain.  Neurologically, the patient has a flat affect but

is oriented with intact cranial nerves and no focal neurologic

deficit in either motor or sensory distribution.  She does,

however, walk with a limp, which is chronic for her.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood count is slightly elevated at 11.3.

 BUN and creatinine is also significantly elevated at 26 and 1.1,

respectively.  Potassium is also quite low at 2.9.  Urinalysis is

positive with 35-40 white blood cells, 15-20 red blood cells, and

2+ bacteria.

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  My chief concern for this patient

is her inability to care for self at home.  It is apparent that

her son is interested in helping her and do so, but the patient

on physical exam has some obvious lack of hygiene and I am

concerned that potentially the patient has either an underlying

neurologic or psychiatric issue that is preventing her from

thriving at home.  Psychiatry initially was consulted.  Their

impression was that the patient may have neuro behavior problem

that needs further outpatient workup, and she was referred to a

specific providers within the next 2 weeks.  The patient was

treated with potassium chloride for her hypokalemia.  Care

coordinator and social services were consulted.  The patient will

have a home safety evaluation and will be referred for primary

care services, was discharged with a cane for ambulation, and

will likely also receive VNA Services to help her with medication

compliance and other ADLs.

 ******** Not reviewed by Attending Physician ********

DIAGNOSES:

1.  Chronic low back pain.

2.  Hypokalemia.

3.  Urinary tract infection.

4.  Failure to thrive.

DISPOSITION:  Discharged.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Satisfactory.

MEDIQUIK Neurology Consultation 

Edward Wilkerson
MRN: 37199514
Please refer to Student Doctor Nicky Li for HPI, ROS and past medical history. 




Briefly, 68 yr old male w a h/o HTN, HL, DMII, peripheral neuropathy, schizoaffective disorder, Borderline Personality Disorder s/p SVT ablation on 4/10 who post-operatively has been confused with gait disturbance. Neurology was consulted for an evaluation of gait disturbance and encephalopathy. On exam patient is normotensive and afebrile with cognition remarkable for inattention, disorientation, perseveration and preservation of speech and visual spatial processing. His physical exam is further remarkable for asterixis and bilateral upper extremity tremulousness. His cranial nerves are intact. His has four limb give way weakness without focality. Reflexes are 3+ and symmetric in the upper extremities and 2+ and symmetric in the lower extremities. Toes are down. Finger to nose is preserved. He is unable to stand without assistance. Differential includes toxic metabolic disturbance (i.e. hyper ammonia in the setting of depakote use vs. drugs of abuse, vs. alcohol withdrawal vs. additional superimposed toxic metabolic disturbance)




Recommendations:

-please check Liver function panel

-check ammonia

-Check B12, folate, RPR, TSH

-please start multivitamin and thiamine 100mg daily
-please check carbamazepine and valproic acid levels; please verify carbamazepine dosing as prior records suggest 400mg QD and patient is on BID dosing

-serum and urine toxicology screen

-obtain collateral history regarding possible alcohol abuse and monitor for alcohol withdrawal

-would hold amitriptyline given anticholinergic properties

-if above workup negative and unrevealing would consider NCHCT but defer imaging at this time

There is currently no evidence of active bleeding from the wound.  A CBC should be obtained in the ED to ensure that her hct is stable and she can then d/c home.  She will follow up with Dr. Ishikawa at her scheduled postop visit.  Should the bleeding persist or return she should return to the ER or the clinic for a vascular U/S to assess for a pseudoaneurysm or AV fistula. 


D/W Dr. Casey Iacono (Surgery Fellow), who agrees with assessment and plan.


Thanks,




Xavier G. England, MD, EdM      #15725

INTERNAL MEDICINE ASSOCIATES

HOUSTON MEDICAL CENTER



Personal data and overall health   This is a 54-year-old woman with hypertension, hyperlipidemia, glucose intolerance, depression, and agoraphobia.



Reason for visit   Extended interval visit.



Major Problems

Depression

/chronic mood disorder with elements of paranoia/(?) psychosis/agoraphobia.  Medicines reviewed.  She will follow up with Dr. Thurston.  She is largely homebound, fearful of her phone, fearful of going out, overeating, under exercising but not despondent or self-destructive.  She does have support from sister and brother who live at home with her. 

P:  Per Dr. Thurston.  Discussed the potential of transitional therapist if she relocates.

Family history risk factors

/ cad;diabetes.  An episode of chest discomfort occurred at rest watching TV.  He had to get up and go to bed.  They were no episymptoms of sweat, nausea, vomiting, and dyspnea, but she did have both chest and left arm discomfort, the duration was an hour, this occurred a month ago.  She has been active since then around the house without pain and had no pain walking in today.  

A:  Episode of chest discomfort with family history of CAD and multiple risk factors. 

P:  Check EKG.  She will call for recurrent symptoms.

Glucose intolerance

/family history of diabetes.  Lots of sugars and carbohydrates.  Weight is up. 

P:  Update hemoglobin A1c next month when she returns for fasting blood; urine microalbumin today; long overdue for an eye exam and she and her sister promised to schedule this.  Diet reviewed and weight program urged.

Hiatal hernia

Only occasional reflux and heartburn but one episode at the holiday rather vigorous reflux with a vomiting episode without chest pain.  There was vigorous vomiting and she actually experienced some blood.  She states ""one-half cup.""  Stools were dark for several days thereafter, then cleared, now normal and she has had no satiety, dysphagia, or recurrent symptoms.  She has a well documented GERD and reflux, and HH on barium swallow in 2123.  She has not been having major breakthrough reflux on Prilosec 20 mg.  

A:  Episode of reflux, vomiting possible esophageal tear with symptoms now abated and color looks good.  She does not appear markedly anemic.  There are no symptoms to suggest Barrett, but obviously this is a consideration. 

P:  Check CBC, stool guaiac for starters and iron level.  If she significantly anemic and these symptoms persist an EGD would be appropriate though he may have to negotiate this, given her agoraphobia.  Minimally, she will stay on Prilosec one or two a day in the meantime and call me if there is anymore vomiting, bleeding, or black stools.

Hypertension

Blood pressure is okay.P:  Continue current treatment.     02/16/2130:

Menstrual disorder

/ status post hysterectomy, BSO for endometriomas, fibroids.  Ran out of Premarin three days ago, not terribly troubled by hot flashes. 

P:  Discontinue Premarin.  If hot flashes reoccur badly, we can go to 0.3 and then wean more slowly.  She will let me know.

Overweight

P:  Encouraged weight loss.     02/16/2130:

Sciatica

No recurrence.     02/16/2130:

Seizure disorder

We will check Tegretol level, CBC, and LFTs.  She is overdue and had episode at the holidays of fainting like feeling without seizure prodrome or seizure activity. 

P:  Check levels.  Call for any further episodes.  Described episode was not clearly arrhythmic by her symptoms and she had no post ictal.  She will let me know if this occurs again and seek attention at that time.

Sleep apnea

Sister states she needs a new sleep device and we will take care of a referral on contact from her supplier.

Gallstones

/ status post cholecystectomy at time of hysterectomy.  The episode of abdominal discomfort and vomiting was not clearly colic and she is post hysterectomy, but might have a recurrent stone.  No obvious icterus today. 

P:  LFT profile.  Call for further difficulties.

Chest pain

CT as above. 

P:  Check EKG.

EDVISIT^89659991^MOSS, DEREK^03/11/89^GODFREY, XAVIER GEORGE

I saw this patient with the resident, Dr. Louvinia Duvall.  Please

see her note for further details.  I confirm that I have

interviewed and examined the patient, reviewed the resident's

documentation on the patient's chart, and discussed the

evaluation, plan of care, and disposition with the patient.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 78-year-old male

with a history of diabetes, hypertension, atrial fibrillation,

congestive heart failure, prostate cancer, chronic renal

insufficiency, and Parkinson disease previously hospitalized 2

weeks prior for right lower extremity cellulitis, which he had a

PICC line placed, and was discharged to home on vancomycin. 

Since that time, he has had progressively increase in his

creatinines despite decreasing doses of vancomycin.  He was

concerned and requested that the patient to come in for a

possible acute renal failure secondary to the antibiotic.  There

is also concern that cellulitis had worsened, as the patient was

experiencing increasing weakness.  He is denying currently any

fevers, chills, or constitutional symptoms.  His baseline

shortness of breath has been going on for months.  No GI

complaints.  He has had a mild headache, but no visual changes,

no focal motor or sensory loss.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: The systems reviewed and found to be negative.

MEDICATIONS:  He has a long list of medications Please see the

chart.

ALLERGIES:  Morphine.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Reviewed and found to be noncontributory.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Reviewed and found to be noncontributory.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Cholecystectomy and bilateral total hip

replacement.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  He is awake, alert, nontoxic appearing,

and in no acute distress.  Vital signs reviewed and found to be

within normal limits.  Afebrile at 95.6.  HEENT exam is

unremarkable.  Mucosal membranes are moist.  Neck is supple. 

Lungs are clear bilaterally.  Heart is regular rate and rhythm,

no murmurs or gallops.  Abdomen:  Soft, nondistended, and

nontender with normoactive bowel sounds.  Skin is warm and dry. 

Extremity exam:  He has right lower extremity cellulitis with 2

small ulcerations and serosanguineous drainage is minimal.  No

evidence of pus.  It is about where it was at the start based on

the initial skin markings.

LABORATORY DATA:  Hematocrit of 32.  However, his BUN has been

150 and creatinine of 3.  This has significantly increased from

his baseline of 1.8-2 he has had in the past.  Vancomycin level

was sent.

DIAGNOSIS:  Cellulitis with acute renal insufficiency most likely

secondary to vancomycin.  This was discussed with his primary

care provider.

DISPOSITION:  He is admitted to the Medicine Service.

NAME:     Umphrey, Tammy 
MRN:       0942207

The patient is here as a walk-in.  Her spouse is present.

Patient says she is status post a fall this past Monday at home.  Says that she seems
to have lost her balance while opening a door at home.  Denies prodromal
symptoms including shortness of breath, dizziness, or palpitations.  There was no
loss of consciousness.  Patient was seen in the emergency room that day for trauma
to the head.  Had a negative CT of her head and had an x-ray of her pelvis, as she
complained of some hip pain.  Both studies were negative.  Patient was then sent
home with Roxicet.  Patient was seen in the walk-in clinic at CPI yesterday, after
noticing a swollen tongue and some difficulty swallowing.  Patient was immediately
told to stop both her Roxicet and Monopril and was treated for angioedema with
Zantac and Claritin.  Today patient has no further throat tightness or tongue
swelling.  She is, however, uncomfortable continuing the Effexor for unclear
reasons and wants to stop it.

Patient is also complaining of severe low back pain, which she says has persisted
since her fall on Monday.  Did not have an x-ray of the area.  Says it is very painful
to sit.  Roxicet was not helping.  She is off her Ultram as well.

PHYSICAL EXAM:  WD/overweight female in NAD.  Vital signs as per LMR,
WNL.  Weight 213 pounds. 

Lungs - clear bilateral breath sounds.  Cor - RRR, S1, S2, without murmur or S3
noted.  Back - slightly bent gait.  Tenderness over lower sacrum.  No asymmetry or
obvious deformity.  

X-ray of sacrum 12/13/63 - could not see fracture as per my reading.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  

(1)  Angioedema.  Agree that most likely culprits are Roxicet since it was started
     only two days ago, and ACE inhibitors which have been associated with
     angioedema.  Currently on Lopressor and Dyazide, patient's blood pressure
     is WNL.  So will follow for now.

(2)  Low back pain.  Reviewed the possibility of a coccygeal fracture for which
     treatment would not be any different than pain management and a donut
     pillow.  Patient was given a prescription for the pillow.  She was told to look
     out for signs of nerve compression and to go to the ER if she experienced
     any perianal numbness or incontinence.  Will notify patient by phone if x-ray
     shows a fracture. 

(3)  Depression.  Did not feel I was able to speak freely in front of the patient's
     spouse.  Had been put on the Effexor by Dr. Zeman.  Advised patient to let
     her psychiatrist know that we are tapering her off of the Effexor.  Will take
     25 mg q.o.d. for the next week.  

(4)  Pain control.  Will switch from Vicodin to Vicodin ES 1 q. 6 as needed. 
     Knows to go to ER if experiences any symptoms consistent with angioedema.

Return to clinic in approximately one month.

BRANCH,EARNEST   530-23-69-1                      VISIT DATE: 12/31/82

This patient was seen primarily by Dr. Xavier Whittaker.  I also saw 

the patient, reviewed the resident's note, and discussed evaluation 

and plan. 

PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  Shortness of breath and nausea.

HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  This 49-year-old man has been 

complaining of shortness of breath for the last 24 hours.  He came 

in complaining of that plus some nausea and was found to have a 

highly elevated glucose and was sent over here.  The patient denies 

any chest pain or pain any place else, but he does state that he 

feels poorly.  Of note, on transport and on arrival here, his blood 

sugar was noted to be greater than 600.  The patient does not 

complain of blurry vision and does not complain of 

light-headedness, just the nausea and the shortness of breath. 

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  As per the resident's note. 

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Cardiomyopathy.  Otherwise, as per the 

resident's note. 

SOCIAL HISTORY AND FAMILY HISTORY:  As per the resident's note. 

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Significant findings include a pulse of 76, 

respirations 22.  The patient appears to be in no acute distress.  

The lungs display crackles bilaterally to the mid lung.  There is 

jugular venous distention elevation to the angle of the jaw.  

Cardiac examination is otherwise normal.  Abdominal examination is 

within normal limits.  The patient has a colostomy.  The patient 

has a left below-knee amputation and toe-digit-toe amputation on 

the right side.  Otherwise, there are no musculoskeletal 

abnormalities.  There are some decubitus ulcers which are stable.

LABORATORY EVALUATION:  Laboratories are significant for a glucose 

of 934, sodium 127, anion gap 17, bicarb 19, creatinine and BUN 5.8 

and 37, hematocrit 30, which is not too different from his usual.  

His pH is 7.42.  CK is 54, but troponin is 1.45.  Of note, however, 

the patient does have renal conditions.  EKG shows new deep Qs in 

2, 3, and F compared to one done a month ago.  Chest x-ray shows 

some excess interstitial markings indicative of increased fluid.

THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  This patient appears to have 

congestive heart failure.  He may be having new cardiac event, 

although after a consultation with the Integra Health

cardiologist, he felt that perhaps this might not be a new event, 

but rather due to axis deviation.  The patient is being treated for 

his hyperglycemia and is being admitted.

FINAL DIAGNOSES:

1.  Rule out myocardial infarction.

2.  Hyperglycemia.

DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  The patient was 

admitted to the hospital in stable condition.

CHANDLER,JESSICA   748-80-38-0                       VISIT DATE: 01/08/70
HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  The patient was seen and 
evaluated by Dr. Wooten.  Please see Dr. Wooten's note.  The 
patient is a 41 year old morbidly obese diabetic female with two 
days of shortness of breath and cough, productive of some whitish 
sputum.  She has had no chest pain, no nausea, no vomiting. 
Minimal diaphoresis.  She has had a fever.  No urinary symptoms. 
She does have chronic renal insufficiency, COPD, CHF and diabetes. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  As above plus status post coronary artery 
bypass grafting. 
MEDICATIONS:  Lasix, Prilosec, Cozaar, aspirin, Paxil, Flovent, 
albuterol and Nephrocaps.

Lungs:  Diffuse rhonchi throughout with bibasilar rales.  The 
abdomen is obese, soft.  Neurologic exam is non-focal. 
LABORATORY EVALUATION:  Chest x-ray shows a poor inspiratory 
effort, no obvious infiltrate, perhaps some hazy infiltrates.  EKG 
is unchanged.  Labs:  Unable to obtain at this time. 
THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  The patient was seen and evaluated. 
Chest x-ray was obtained.  The patient has an IV established but 
were unable to draw labs.  Under my direct supervision and with 
some attempts by me, multiple attempts are made at the 
infraclavicular and supraclavicular left and right subclavian vein 
without success.  The groins bilateral have damp, moist exudate and 
the neck anatomy is difficult to assess.  We are unable to 
establish a line.  She has a chest x-ray for rule out of 
pneumothorax or hemothorax and she will need an arterial stick for 
blood draws. 
IMPRESSION:  Hypoxia, possible pneumonia and a facial abscess. 
PLAN:  Admission. 
DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  Condition on 
admission is stable.

cystoscopy

Patient was placed in the supine  position and prepped and draped in the standard sterile fashion.  Lidocaine jelly was inserted into the meatus for local anaesthesia.  A flexible cystoscope was inserted into the meatus.  The urethra was without lesions.  The lateral lobes of the prostate coapted at the midline.  The stent was identified and using alligator forceps the distal portion was grasped.  It was removed intact.  The patient tolerated the procedure and was discharged from the clinic after receiving ciprofloxacin.



Laboratory Values:

An independent review of a urinalysis shows:

                          No WBC's

                          +  RBC's

Abdomen Single                 22-Mar-2081 

REPORT:

	History: As above.

	Comparison:Noncontrast CT abdomen and pelvis 3/14/81.

	Findings:

	There is a left ureteral stent.  Tiny residual stones seen on

	prior CT are not identified on this KUB.The bowel gas pattern is

	nonobstructive.      The bones are unremarkable in appearance. The

	visualized lung bases are unremarkable.

IMPRESSION:

	LEFT URETERAL STENT.  NO ABNORMAL CALCIFICATIONS IDENTIFIED.

		

	

Impression:  50 yo male treated for a 1.1 cm symptomatic left renal stone.   His post-operative KUB does not show any calcifications.  The stent was removed intact without difficulty.   He is to have a follow up CT in June with and without contrast for further evaluation of a renal lesion seen on a previous CT scan.  He did have a post-operative CT that showed a subcapsular hematoma for which his blood pressure will be followed.   That study also showed the stone which is no longer visualized on todays KUB.  The imaging in June will again assess his stone burden.

        

Plan:   

1  CT abd/pelvis I-/I+ in June



Follow Up:  in June

                                                                                                                                   Mae Paul

Flexible sigmoidoscopy to 25 cm (sigmoid) normal except mild diverticulosis.  



IMPRESSION:

Large symptomatic hemorrhoids.  They are too big for office treatment.  Therefore discussed the option of hemorrhoidectomy, which would probably give her a nice result.  She wishes to think about it for now, however, which is fine.  In the meantime, gave her info brochure plus instructions in conservative RX hemorrhoids.

occasional dull headache.  However, her main concern is her stomach and 
her back.  Ms. Pickett continues to have postprandial nausea and discomfort 
in her epigastrium, particularly after eating.  This is different than her 
reflux disease, which she feels is under fairly good control, with the 
Prilosec-Propulsid combination.  She is describing some anorexia, although 
she has not lost any weight.  She has not had any alterations in her bowel 
movements.  She has not been constipated or had diarrhea.  She wonders 
whether this could be in gallbladder.  In addition, she is continuing to 
have some back pain with radiation down her left leg in the L5/S1 
distribution.  She had one epidural steroid injection but was due to go 
back.  Given her upper respiratory tract infection, this was postponed.  
 
She is not having any heart symptoms or shortness of breath.  Her sugars 
have been under good control, ranging between 111 and 143.  Her blood 
pressure is 152/70 today, with a pulse of 70.  She is saturating well.
 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical exam, lungs were clear to auscultation.  
There was no JVD.  Heart: regular rate and rhythm with positive S4, ? S3 
with no significant murmur.  Abdomen was soft, nondistended, with some 
mild tenderness without rebound or guarding over the right upper quadrant.  
Abdomen was somewhat bloated per patient and diffusely tender.  
Extremities revealed some mild pedal edema left greater than right.  
 
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  A seventy-one-year-old woman with multiple medical 
issues, including coronary artery disease, CHF, diabetes, hypertension, 
and cerebrovascular disease.  She came in today for discussion of her 
ongoing lumbar radiculopathic pain as well as her abdominal complaint.
 
With regard to her back pain, she wanted a prescription for Tylenol with 
codeine, which has helped in the past.  I gave her a prescription.  I 
warned her about the possible side effects of constipation.  She should 
contact the pain clinic as soon as she feels able, for a repeat epidural 
steroid injection.
 
With regard to her abdominal complaints, the bubbling in her chest, 
postprandial nausea and anorexia could certainly be due to gallbladder 
disease.  Unclear contribution from her reflux.  Dr. Mario Robison 
recommended elective cholecystectomy.  Given the fact that Ms. Pickett is 
being more and more bothered by these symptoms, it may be reasonable to

consider her for the surgery.  I have asked her to call Dr. Xiques and 
make an appointment to discuss her cardiovascular risk so that she can 
make an informed decision about the surgery.  
 
She is otherwise up to date with her issues and doing relatively well from 
a cardiovascular and diabetic perspective.  She would probably do better 
with lower blood pressure.  We could consider increasing her Imdur.  
 
I plan to follow up with her in a few weeks time.

Jessica returns today for follow-up after her admission for acute
shortness of breath and congestive heart failure.  I had added
Zaroxolyn on to her regimen which she is tolerating well.  However,
her recent laboratory studies show that she has a significant
increase in her BUN and creatinine.  Her BUN is in the 80's, and
her creatinine is about 3.4.  She states her breathing has been
excellent, however.  She is not experiencing as much dyspnea on
exertion.  She is sleeping through the night, and she is no longer
having any kind of dry cough.  
 
Medications:  Her current medicines are Nephrocaps 1 tablet p.o.
q.day, Paxil 20 p.o. q.day, Cozaar 50 p.o. q.day, Prilosec 20 mg
p.o. q. day, Atenolol 50 p.o. q.day, Lasix 120 p.o. b.i.d.,
Zaroxolyn 2.5 p.o. q.day, Albuterol nebulizers p.r.n., nph 40 units
in the morning and 40 units at night time and aspirin 81 mg p.o.
q.day.
 
Allergies:  Cephalexin causes questionable rash.
 
Physical Examination:  Today she is a pleasant black female in no
acute distress.  Her weight is 330 pounds.  This is down over 20
pounds over the past month.  Her blood pressure is 122/80.  Her
pulse is 80.  Her lungs are clear.  Her heart reveals distant heart
sounds but regular in rhythm and rate.  Her extremities are notable
for the absence of lower extremity edema.  Her abdomen is also
noted to be significantly less edematous than it has been in the
past.  Inspection of her left lower extremity reveals that she
continues to have an ulcer over the lateral aspect of the foot on
the plantar surface that measures 2 x 3 cm.  There is beefy red
granulation tissue surrounding this.  
 
Diagnosis:
     1.   Congestive heart failure.  
     2.   Coronary artery disease, status post CABG.
     3.   Morbid obesity.
     4.   Adult onset diabetes mellitus.
     5.   Chronic renal insufficiency.
     6.   Foot ulcer.
     7.   Depression.
     8.   Health maintenance.

Plan:
     1.   Congestive heart failure.  She is doing much better on
higher doses of diuretics with a weight loss of over 20 pounds
since her last visit here about a month ago.  At this point in
time, however, I think that we need to cut back on her Zaroxolyn
given the elevation in her BUN and creatinine, and I've asked her
to hold her Zaroxolyn dosage and continue on a relatively low-fat
and low-sodium diet and to have a scale and obtain daily weights,
and she will follow-up with me in the office in two weeks and per
telephone conversation in four days.  Should she have an increase
in her weight by more than five pounds, she will contact me.
     2.   Coronary artery disease, status post CABG.  Stable
without any symptoms of exertional chest pain.  Continue current
medication. 
     3.   Morbid obesity.  She decided not to go to the Frankfort State Hospital weight loss program.  I strongly wanted her to go
on a liquid protein diet plan, but she states it's inconvenient for
her to come to the Hospital at night time for the meetings.  She is
planning to try and enroll in a program at Sibley Care.  I told her I would help her out in any way possible, but
strongly reinforced to her the need for her to take off weight.  
     4.   Adult-onset diabetes mellitus.  Stable.  Continue current
regimen.  
     5.   Chronic renal insufficiency.  The plan as above is to
stop Zaroxolyn and repeat electrolytes in five days. 
     6.   Diabetic foot ulcer.  I also gave her a duoderm dressing
to try, and she is going to continue to follow-up with her
podiatrist, and I will speak with her visiting nurse about
appropriate treatment.

NAME:     Yager, Becky

MRN:      0887181



Becka returns for follow-up of painful neuropathy. She showed me a foot ulcer

that she has had since early August. In fact, this was debrided on August 9 by Dr.

Noyes and was found to contain Staph aureus sensitive to oxacillin and Bactrim.

She was treated with Augmentin for 2 weeks with little improvement. She has not

had any fever. She continues on her chronic pain medications and Percocet. 



On exam, the second toe on the right foot is severely swollen and red. There is an

ulcer which looks quite deep on the medial aspect of the toe. I had Dr. Drew

take a look at her foot who agreed that she should be seen in the emergency room. 



IMPRESSION:  Cellulitis/right toe ulcer - Persistent infection and unresponsiveness

to 2-week course of Augmentin raise concern of underlying osteomyelitis. Rebecca

was referred into the emergency room for further evaluation. She also was given a

new prescription for her Percocet #100. I will see her in follow-up in 1 month.

RE:Branch, Earnest
MRN:53023691
 
Dear Dr. Xayarath:
 
Your patient Earnest Branch came in the office today for a follow up 
visit.  Mr. Branch is now two years out from a right femoral-
tibial bypass and nine months out from a left femoral-tibial 
bypass with subsequent transmetatarsal amputation of the left foot 
and split-thickness skin grafting.  Over the last several months, 
he has been undergoing dressing changes to remaining, small, 
superficial, open wounds on the dorsum of the left foot.  Over the 
last one to two weeks, he began to note the development of a new 
area of dark skin on the lateral aspect of the left foot and 
recently has noted some drainage.  He denies any fevers.  In 
addition and of note, he complains of recent onset of pain in the 
right eye and has an appointment at the Ophthalmology Clinic 
immediately following his visit with us.  He last underwent 
vascular lab studies in September at which time both lower 
extremity bypass grafts were widely patent and without stenoses.
 
On examination today, there are strong, easily palpable pulses 
over both lower extremity bypass grafts.  The right foot is warm 
and without any new ischemic skin changes or lesions.  On 
examination of the left foot, there is a large area of full-
thickness skin necrosis on the lateral aspect of the foot where 
there had never been any previous open wounds.  This area 
encompasses a significant proportion of the lateral aspect of the 
foot from the end of the transmetatarsal incision to the proximal 
mid foot.  On probing, purulent material drains from the margins 
and there is obvious significant sepsis.  The foot itself is warm 
and there is a good posterior tibial Doppler signal at the ankle.
 
Unfortunately, Mr. Branch has developed a new, large wound on the 
left foot which likely began as a pressure (decubitus) ulceration 
due to his severe neuropathy.  This is now complicated by 
significant local sepsis and there is a large area of soft tissue 
loss on the foot.  He will require urgent admission and operative 
debridement today.  In addition, given the extent of the problem, 
it is likely that he will ultimately come to below-knee amputation 
in the end.  Immediately following his visit to the Ophthalmology 
Clinic, he will be admitted to the

hospital with the hopes of performing debridement and drainage 
later today.  I will certainly continue to keep you apprised of 
his progress.
 
Sincerely,

Patient Name: UMPHREY, FRANKIE;  MRN: 0942207
Dictated on: 08/28/2064 by WHITNEY EASTERLING, M.D. 

 
CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Falling and low back pain.  
 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 66 year old, right-handed female whose past medical history is significant for status post laminectomy at L3 to L5 in January of 2061.  The patient was in her usual state of health with some residual weakness from the stenosis and occasional buckling of her knees without loss of consciousness until 12/01 when she fell backwards.  There was no obvious leg buckling.  She said she just came off balance without loss of consciousness or dizziness or preceding lightheadedness.  Since then she has had several falls always when she is moving.   
MEDICATIONS:  Her medications have included in the past Motrin 800 t.i.d. without significant effect on her low back pain.  Ultram q.i.d. was beneficial.  Neurontin 300 q.i.d. which was also beneficial without side effect and chondroitin sulfate which she feels has been very helpful without side effect.   
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  She has bilateral dysesthesias, left sciatica to her ankle.  She has had weight loss without fevers, chills or night sweat.  She has had no retinopathy and she has a history of reflux and otherwise her cardiovascular, pulmonary, GI/GU and musculoskeletal review of systems are unremarkable.   
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Spinal stenosis with a laminectomy at L3, 4 and 5 in January of 2061.  She has had left knee arthroscopy.  She had mild spinal stenosis at T12 to L1, severe at L3/4 and 4/5 with bilateral foraminal disease.  She has had a ten year history of diabetes.  She has hypertension and hypothyroidism.   
MEDICATIONS:  Synthroid, Premarin, glynase, glucophage, metoprolol and Effexor.  
 
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.  
 
SOCIAL HISTORY:  She is married.  No history of tobacco or alcohol.  
 
FAMILY HISTORY:  Positive for coronary artery disease, breast cancer and diabetes.  
 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She is a well-appearing, well-nourished, 66 year old female.  Her mental state examination is normal.  Cranial nerves II through XII are intact.  Motor strength is significant for full strength in the upper extremities as well as the lower extremities.  Sensation is intact to all modalities with bilateral lower extremity dysesthesia reported subjectively.  DTR's are symmetric with downgoing toes bilaterally.  Coordination is intact with no axial or appendicular ataxia.   
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  This is a 66 year old right-handed female with history of spinal stenosis status post decompression who has a history of falls.  We will obtain an MRI of her lumbosacral to evaluate that area for any recurrent pathology or new changes.  For her radicular pain will increase her Neurontin 400 q.i.d.  We would like to obtain EMG with nerve conduction studies of the lower extremities to evaluate possible need for reoperation.  The patient will return to clinic after these studies.  The patient was seen and evaluated and management was discussed with the attending.

EDVISIT^47190847^JORGENSON, VIVIANLEE^05/29/78^XUEREB, VESTER

I saw this patient with Dr. Wendy Wu, resident.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Chief complaint on the chart is ataxia, when I

speak with the patient chief complaint is weakness.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 71-year-old female with a

history of atrial fibrillation on Coumadin.  She presents with

episodes of gait instability, diffuse weakness, multiple falls. 

She was brought in by her family for further evaluation.  She

also had dark stools over the past few weeks.  She denies any

associated chest pain, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, any

syncope, any nausea or vomiting.  She does have a bruise on her

chin.  She denies any focal weakness, numbness, or tingling.  No

hematuria, no epistaxis or gum bleeding.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Congestive heart failure, atrial

fibrillation, hypertension, coronary artery disease,

hypercholesterolemia, and thyroid disease.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She lives with family.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  As noted in the written chart and the HPI,

otherwise negative.

MEDICATIONS:  Include ranitidine, baby aspirin, Coumadin, Lasix,

and digoxin.

ALLERGIES:  None.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 96.5, pulse 60, respiratory

rate 20, blood pressure 136/60, and oxygen 95% on room air. 

General:  This is a pleasant female, elderly; she has got a 3-cm

ecchymosis over her mid left chin as well as over her left

shoulder.  Her pupils are reactive.  Neck is supple. 

Respiratory:  Clear to auscultation.  Cardiovascular:  Regular

rate.  Abdomen is soft.  Rectal is heme-positive, heme-positive

melena per the resident.  Skin is otherwise with bruises over the

left arm as well as a bruise over the right thumb that appears

healing.  Extremities are with good range of motion.  No focal

tenderness.  She is oriented x3.  Mood and affect are normal. 

She is moving all extremities equally.

LABORATORY DATA:  Chest x-ray shows no acute cardiomediastinal

process and head CT preliminary shows no intracranial

abnormalities.  Laboratory studies are remarkable for hematocrit

of 16, creatinine of 1.5, BUN of 95, troponin less than 0.04, and

platelets of 358.  INR of 2.  Urinalysis with 2+ ketones, no

blood.

INITIAL IMPRESSION AND PLAN:  This 71-year-old female presents

with generalized weakness and gait instability and frequent

falls, concerning for either an evolving intracranial process

such as a subdural or stroke.  This has been going on for several

weeks, however, but also presents with melena over the past

several weeks and profound anemia for which she required

transfusion in the Emergency Department.  We did order a CT of

the brain to evaluate for intracranial injury or abnormality both

given the frequent falls and as the cause of the falls.  This

does not show any large subdural or mass lesion.  She is quite

anemic has melanotic heme-positive stool.  I suspect this is the

etiology, but it seems like it has been a slow progression, and

concerned given her cardiac history also the weakness and could

represent coronary insufficiency.  She does not have an elevated

troponin at present.  She will need to be further monitored.  She

was transfused here in the Emergency Department given her

profoundly low hematocrit after consent was obtained. 

Clinically, feels better.  I discussed with the patient's family

because of the bleeding he will need to be evaluated as ____

further cardiac biomarkers and further monitoring as well as

physical therapy evaluation once the patient's acute medical

issues have been addressed.  She will be admitted to the medical

service with diagnosis of symptomatic anemia, gastrointestinal

bleeding, congestive heart failure, and atrial fibrillation in

stable condition.

Christopher presents with his significant other, Emily, for review of peripheral vascular disease, hypertension, renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, rib pain, and gout. They going back to  New Jersey.



Bronchitis:  he has developed cough w/ yellow phlegm w/o fever or chills or rigors.  he has more coughing at night. he is SOB w/ transfers. 

He has rhonchi in right lower lobe.

a/p bronchitis vs pna in former smoker w/ COPD. will obtain CXR. 

rx w/ levoflox and rob AC (sugar free)



Diabetes mellitus: His blood sugar has been well controlled. He states that his glucose is usually between 100 and at most 150. He does have microalbuminuria and renal insufficiency and neuropathy. He does have peripheral vascular disease and coronary artery disease as well as diabetes mellitus. We will need to check hemoglobin A1c to determine the level of control. Last hemoglobin A1c was June 2093, and it was 6.8. Continue current management of diabetes mellitus with insulin. Continue to treat and monitor blood pressure. Patient is intolerant of ACE inhibitor due to renal dysfunction. 



Renal dysfunction: He has seen Dr. Krause from Renal associates. He does have bilateral renal artery stenosis. He has also seen Dr. Locklear for consideration of intervention for renal artery stenosis. Patient cannot tolerate an ACE inhibitor. Will plan to monitor blood pressure and avoid hyper and hypotension. He will have imaging today.  



Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: The patient has obstructive lung disease. Is currently not short of breath at rest. Only short of breath with activity. Currently using Advair, and Combivent. He also uses Atrovent or albuterol nebulizers as needed. Lungs are without wheezes today. There are fine expiratory rhonchi. Assessment is chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Plan will be to continue current management.

Personal Data and Overall Health	

75 year old right handed man with pure motor hemiparesis synrdrome on right from L IC stroke in 6/32.



History of Present Illness	

Mr. Slater comes to the stroke clinic today for an initial visit and second opinion for left-sided weakness starting in 6/25/32. He was golfing at the time, and suddenly developed weakness with no sensory changes. The weakness involved the face, arm and leg on the left side only. He went to Gilmore Hospital, where they checked his blood pressure, and found it to be 220/140 (per his report). A CT scan was performed, and he was informed that it was normal. He became frustrated with the ER there and signed out AMA. He went to the HCH at Easton 2 days later, his BP was still elevated, and they started him on clonidine. They attempted to arrange for a renal angiogram to work up his hypertension, but he declined. No further stroke/TIA workup was performed.



He comes to me for a second opinion regarding his workup. His weakness has greatly improved, but not back to normal. He has never had sensory changes, and no speech difficulties, anosognosia, neglect, or gait instability. He did have ""flashing lights in both eyes"" for fifteen minutes at the onset of the symptoms on the golf course, but none since then. He has never had transient monocular blindness, diplopia, or suddenly blurry vision.



Past Medical History	

Hypertension.

He is being worked up for possible renal artery stenosis. 

He has not had his cholesterol checked.



Medications	    

PROPRANOLOL (PROPRANOLOL HCL)	 40MG PO BID Start Date: 10/1/32

HCTZ (HYDROCHLOROTHIAZIDE)	 12.5MG PO QD Start Date: 10/1/32

CLONIDINE HCL	 0.2MG PO BID Start Date: 10/1/32

ZESTRIL (LISINOPRIL)	 40MG PO QD Start Date: 10/1/32

ASA (ACETYLSALICYLIC ACID)	 81MG PO QD Start Date: 10/1/32



Allergies	  

NKDA	      



Social History	

lives in Avenal. Retired journalist. Widowed.

quit smoking in June, former 1 ppd x 60 years.

EtOH: couple of drinks 1-2 times per week.



Family History	

HTN in mother, aunt. 

Father died of cancer. 

No stroke



Review of Systems	

denies chest pain, SOB, palpitations.





Exam	

HEENT: NC/AT, O/P clear. Neck supple, no bruits.

Lungs: CTA bilaterally.    CV: RRR, no M/R/G. 

Abd: soft, NT/ND, + BS.    EXT: no CCE

Neuro: A, Ox3. Speech fluent, non-dysarthric. Naming, repetition intact. STM 3/3 at 5 min. Follows 3-step R/L commands. 

CN: VFFTC, EOMI without nystagmus. PERRL     

facial sensation, symmetry and strength intact. Hearing intact bilaterally. Palate moves symmetrically. SCM strength full bilaterally. Tongue midline. 

Motor: nl bulk and tone. Power 5/5 throughout. No drift.

Sensation: intact to LT, PP, temp, vib, PS throughout. 

Coord: nl FNF, HKS bilaterally. Gait normal-based, good toe, heel and tandem walk. 

DTR's: 2 throughout, toes downgoing.



Plan	

I have reviewed Mr. Slater's CT scan, and he has a lacunar infarct of the left posterior internal capsule, which explains his pure motor hemiparesis syndrome. I have counseled him that most likely the best treatment for this type of stroke is to control his hypertension, and to use antiplatelet agents. I have asked that he increase his dose of ASA to 325 mg per day.



In addition, he needs a work up. I have arranged for him to have CNIS, 24 hour Holter monitoring, and TTE with bubble study. Additionally, we should check fasting lipids. 



He wishes to have a PCP at FPC, and I have requested that he have the next available appointment with Dr. Harry Tolliver of the cardiology department, who could also be instrumental in adjusting his hypertension meds. 



He will return to clinic in 2-3 months, and is to page me immediately with any new symptoms or concerns.

Dr. Harry Tolliver, FPC cardiology unit.

Dear Dr. Short:

I did see Irene Upshur for a followup today.  As you know, I did see her back in September where she was diagnosed with possible right-sided eustachian tube dysfunction.  Her blood sugars have been under reasonably good control, 88 and then 300.  She reports that her hearing has continued to fluctuate.  When questioned, she reports that she only used the nose spray twice since I did prescribe it.

On examination today, she otherwise appears well.  Ears are unremarkable.  Her eardrums are intact.  She has no tympanosclerosis or cholesteatoma.  Her gait is normal.  There is no nystagmus.

An audiogram done today does show a sloping high frequency sensorineural hearing loss, which is symmetric.  Her discrimination scores are 100% in the right ear and 100% in the left ear.

Assessment:  Mild ear fullness with dysequilibrium and blockage.

Plan:  She does take multiple medications.  It continues to be very unclear to me what her underlying causality is.  I would like her to use the nasal spray more consistently.  If she does fail this and this is not eustachian tube dysfunction, I would consider her to have endolymphatic hydrops.  This would respond hopefully to a diuretic and potassium supplementation.  However, she has taken multiple medications currently for both blood pressure including atenolol, Cozaar, Lasix, and verapamil.  I would need to clear to switch herself ??____?? therapy, I would like to see her back after consistent trial of the corticosteroid spray topically.

Sincerely,


______________________________

Dear Dr. Schmidt:

Your patient, Hannah Hendricks, was in the Surgery Clinic today.  As you know, she is a 52-year-old woman with a history of peripheral vascular disease.  She underwent a redo left femoral to anterior tibial bypass graft using basilic and cephalic vein from her right arm on May 3, 2078.  She has done well since the procedure.  She is now comes here complaining of left foot pain.  She had an ultrasound in the vascular lab to rule out a DVT, which it did.  She explains the discomfort as pain and burning in the bottom of her foot as well as her arch and over the dorsum of the foot.  


On exam, she is a well appearing female in no acute distress.  She is alert and oriented x3.  She appears grossly neurologically intact.  Her lower extremity exam reveals easily palpable bypass graft pulse in her left leg.  Her left foot is warm and well perfused and she has a very small pinhole ulcer over the plantar aspect of her left great toe.  This does not appear infected and I cannot probe to bone.  It remains superficial.  She has no other ischemic skin changes noted. 


I have discussed with Hannah that her discomfort most likely is due to peripheral neuropathy due to her diabetes.  She also experienced this discomfort prior to her surgery.  She is enquiring about starting Neurontin.  I have said she would be able to try either Neurontin or Lyrica to help with the peripheral neuropathy.  She will return next week for her postoperative graft scan to assess her circulation.  She knows to contact us sooner if thing worsen. 


If I can be of further assistance in her care, do not hesitate to contact me.


Sincerely,


Hunter Shea, MD

Personal Data and Overall Health

Mrs. Barr is a 57  years old lady with multiple significant medical problems new to KEKELA.



Chief Complaint

She is here today for a Physical  Exam



History of Present Illness

Patient has HO HTN for years and CVA. She has had 4 CVAs in the past. First one in 2087, 2088, 2089 and 2090. She was not taking her BP meds those times and she has been smoking 1 PPD since then despite being told she had to quit smoking.

She was seen at the LDC ED twice in Jan 13 and 21/05. First visit she was taken by her son after he couldn't take care of her anymore. Not doing anything at home, not caring about anything. Was seen by psych and arranged to have a PCP, spoke about therapy as well. 

Then 1/21/93 seen for chest pain. EKG negative and was D/C home. Had a MIBI done 1/23/93

    

     1.  Clinical Response:  Non-ischemic.

     2.  ECG Response:  No ECG changes during infusion.

     3.  Myocardial Perfusion:  Normal.

     4.  Global LV Function:  Normal.





She states she is supposed to be on Coumadin for the strokes and she self D/C it last year. Previous PCP at EDUCARE-FARGO Dr. Nancy Odell. Changing to KEKELA because her son thinks she can get better help here. 



She looks depressed and I mentioned that to her. She states ""I always have looked the same"". After speaking for her for 20 minutes she tells me that at age 28 she had a miscarriage of her twins. She was jumping rope and after coming back home her husband told her if she was trying to kill the twins. That night she had a miscarriage and one baby was born in the toilet and the otherone was taken by the EMTs. She was 4 months pregnant. She had therapy then and meds and felt a little better. Her husband died 6 years ago and before he died he reminded her that she had killed his twins. She felt bad and has felt bad since. She cries during interview.

She worked for many years for mcilhenny company, Fire Chief and retird last year. 

She denies being depressed, denies suicidal ideation or plan. States has trouble sleeping and wants AMbien she has taken in the past. Also has taken Zoloft in the past. Not interested on meds now.

Continue  taking HCTZ QD # 30 and 6 refills and follow up in 6 weeks for BP check.

Increase Metroprolol to 50 mg BID # 60 and 6 refills

Increased risk for CAD and needs to modify life style.

	OAKLAND ASSOCIATES CENTER
	


	Reason for visit:
   A 63 yr old man with CAD and extensive PAD history s/p multiple peripheral PCI's admitted after elective cardiac &amp;amp; peripheral angiography and LSFA cryoplasty/PTA/stents.


	Interval History:
   Patient is a 63-year-old with long-standing right-greater-than-left claudication 
The Fall of 77, he could only walk about 25 feet before experiencing 
pain. Exercise ABI's revealed R ABI drop from 0.65 to 0.16 and L ABI drop from 0.74 to 0.24. An MRA revealed non-obstructive plaque in the common iliacs, 50% left external iliac and question of disease in right internal iliac; 40 to 60% common femoral and 40 to 50% stenosis more distally with 60 to 70% serial left SFA stenoses. He had a totally occluded anterior tibialis bilaterally with 60 to 80% trifurcation area disease and high grade posterior tibial on the right and occluded posterior tibial on the left. 
10/77 he was admitted with angina and ruled out for an MI. A cardiac catheterization revealed 50% focal LM lesion, mid 100% LAD lesion, 60 mid LCX, 50-70 OM2, 40-50 dominant RCA distal lesion with an EF of 65%. He has been treated medically without any further angina. 
. 
11/77 peripheral angiography revealed 40-60% LIIA lesion, 50-80 LSFA stenosis, 40-60 L profunda lesion, totally occluded L AT &amp;amp; L PT, R EIA 60% lesion, RIIA 40-60 proximal &amp;amp; 70-90 mid disease, totally occluded R AT &amp;amp; R PT, 70-80 R peroneal. The LSAF was treated with PTA/Xpert 6 x 60 stent, the R EIA lesion was treated with Palmaz Blue 6 x 24 stent. 
6/78 he was taken for peripheral angiography which revealed 30% REIA ISR, mod-sev bil IIA disease, R SFA 70-75, TO AT/PT and 50-60 peroneal. The proximal R SFA was treated with PTA, mid was tx with DCA/PTA 
Since then he has experienced exertional and rest CP occasionally requiring SL TNG with relief. In addition, he has experienced SOB with stair climbing but denies SOB with chest pain. He also has been experiencing claudication with left leg worse than right which has been preventing him from performing exercise. 

A ETT MIBI was done 10/31/78 where he exercised for 3 minutes 53 seconds. He complained of b/l leg claudication and chest pain and actually fell on the treadmill because "" his legs gave out"". Imaging revealed anterior, apical and septal ischemia as well as an EF of 49% and anterior and septal HK. Dr Barton put him on trial of Nitrodur, however, he developed lightheadedness and it was stopped. 
He was referred for cardiac and peripheral angiography. 
Preliminary Cardiac Cath reports reveals TO LAD with distal LAD filling from RCA collaterals (unchanged from previous cath). Peripheral angiography was performed and cryoplasty was performed to the LSFA for ISR as well as Precise 6x30 stent to LSFA and Cypher 2.5x30 stent to the tibeo-peroneal trunk. He arrived on Cardio. divis. in NAD.

RE:  Vivian Lea Jorgenson

     MR#471-90-84-7

 

Dear Dr. Geiger:

 

Thank you for referring your patient, Victoria Carina Jorgenson to me for a

preoperative evaluation for thyroidectomy on September 17, 2071. 

As you know, she is a 64 year old woman with hypertension,

hyperlipidemia and a positive family history of coronary disease. 

She noticed a nodule in her neck in April or May of this year and

brought it to the attention of her doctors and given that it has

increased in size, it is felt to be a potential malignancy and

she is currently scheduled to undergo thyroidectomy in September

of this year.  In terms of her cardiac history, she was well

until four years ago when she developed acute shortness of breath

and was admitted to Lake Park Hospital for congestive heart

failure.  At that time, she had an exercise Thallium scan which

revealed a low work load at only 3 minutes stopping secondary to

shortness of breath with a large fixed anterolateral defect and a

dilated left ventricle.  In addition, she had an echo in June of

2071, which shows an ejection fraction of 25% with 1+ mitral

regurgitation, left atrial enlargement and diastolic dysfunction. 

She has never been hospitalized since that time for her

congestive heart failure and has been treated medically with good

result. She currently denies any orthopnea, PND, angina or

claudication.  She does have chronic mild lower extremity edema.

In fact, she has never had chest pain or chest pressure to her

recollection.  She is able to walk up the 10 stairs to her house

and can unload groceries from her car, up those stairs. She is

able to shop, walk through the grocery store without difficulty

from chest 

 

Jorgenson, Vivian Lea

MR #471-90-84-7               -2-            August 21, 2071

 

pains or shortness of breath, although she occasionally stops

secondary to fatigue.  

 

Her past medical history includes hypertension, hyperlipidemia,

CHF, chronic anxiety and this thyroid nodule. She has never had

surgery. Her family history is significant for a mother who died

of myocardial infarction at the age of 55. 

 

Her social history, she smoked 1-2 packs of cigarettes a day for

40 years and quit four years ago. She denies alcohol, intravenous

drugs or cocaine use.  She lives with her husband and briefly

worked in Amy's Baking Company but for the past 20 years is an electrical engineer.  She

has no known drug allergies. 

 

Her current medications include Labetalol 100mg po BID, Captopril

50 po TID, Digoxin 0.25mg po QD, Coumadin 5 po QD, Lipitor 10 po

QD, Lasix 40 po QD, Coreg 12.5 po BID, Nitroglycerin patch daily

and Gemfibrozil 600mg BID.  

 

On physical exam in my office, her blood pressure was 170/85 in

her left arm and 165/70 in her right. Her heart rate was 104 when

I saw her, although it was 80 on her EKG today. Her JVP was 7

centimeters. Her carotids were brisk upstrokes without carotid

bruits. Her chest is clear to auscultation without crackles. Her

heart has a non displaced PMI with a regular rate and rhythm with

occasional ectopic beats. She has a normal S1 and S2 with a 2/6

systolic ejection murmur at the left upper sternal border without

radiation. Her abdomen is soft with positive bowel sounds. Her

extremities have 2+ distal pulses and trace peripheral edema.  

 

Her EKG today is normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 80.  She has a

diffuse ST and T wave abnormality consistent with Digoxin

effects.  She has poor R wave progression consistent with an old

anterior septal MI but no acute ischemic changes.  

 

In summary, Ms. Jorgenson is a 64 year old woman with hypertension,

hyperlipidemia and a positive family history of coronary disease

with congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 25%,

likely secondary to coronary disease from an anterior myocardial

infarction, although she has never undergone heart

catheterization.  She is currently undergoing evaluation for a

thyroidectomy for a thyroid nodule. 

 

Jorgenson, Vivian Lea

MR #471-90-84-7               -3-            August 21, 2071

 

Issue number one,  preoperative cardiovascular risk assessment: 

given that she has not had an assessment of her ischemic burden

since 2067, I have scheduled her for a repeat exercise test with

imaging. If this is similar to her previous study showing only

fixed defects and no reversible ischemia, then I feel that she

will be of low to moderate risk for surgery for perioperative

myocardial infarction and that her congestive heart failure is

well treated and therefore, will not preclude her from having

surgery.  

 

Issue number two, is her anticoagulation for low ejection

fraction.  She is currently on Coumadin for low ejection

fraction. As far as I know, she has never had atrial fibrillation

and she has never been told that she had an irregular rate or

rhythm.  Therefore, I recommend that she stop her Coumadin 6 days

prior to surgery and it can be restarted several days after

surgery without Heparin overlap at the discretion of the surgeons

as to how may days she should wait after surgery before

restarting that medication.  She will otherwise remain on her

current medical regimen as determined by her cardiologist and

primary care physician, Dr. Charles Van.  If her stress test

is without reversible defects, she need not follow up with me for

further evaluation.  

 

Thank you for referring this interesting patient. She was seen

and examined with Dr. Voss. 

 

Sincerely,

Internal Medicine Admission Note

Name: Crawford, Patrick
MR#:  9021555
Date of Admission: 04.15.94 
PCP: Ehlers, Willa
Attending: Ward
Admitting Resident: Kimberly Ring

CC: 83 y/o man w/ known CAD presenting with near syncope

HPI:  
83 y/o man w/ CAD, (no stents), followed by Dr. Youmans, presents after an episode of diaphoresis and    upchucking    after helping his sister clean out the water in her basement (this happened Saturday am). Of note, he had one episode of diarrhea that morning. He denied any fevers or chills, or nausea or vomiting prior to this episode. When he started vigorously removing the water from the floor, he began feeling lightheaded and nauseated, and was told he was diaphoretic. He sat down on the stairs with assistance from the plumber, and    upchucked.    After vomiting he still felt dizzy and lightheaded. Ems was called, and upon arrival at the ED, he had another episode of diarrhea. At no point did he have chest pain. He did not lose consciousness. This felt somewhat similar to an episode of near syncope he had in 2092. 
In general, he is limited in his activity by his osteoarthritis. However, he walks up stairs regularly and gardens without chest pain. The only new medicine change is an increase in his norvasc. He has not been experiencing any palpitations, or shortness of breath. He denies any headache, visual changes, dysuria, abdominal pain, sore throat. He has heard that there is a bug going around, but denies sick contacts. 
ED Course:
Upon presentation to ED, HR 50, BP 141/62, 18, 99% RA, afebrile. Given aspirin, home meds, beta blocker held for bradycardia. Decided to admit despite negative troponins and no EKG changes because symptoms of dizziness when walking persisted. 

ROS: 
Negative in detail; positives noted in HPI. 

Medical History:
1. CAD: Adenosine mibi showed reversible, moderate, anteroseptal defect. Cath 10/92 with mild to moderate LAD (focal 50% stenosis in proximal third; focal 50% stenosis of mid third at ostia of second diaganol artery) and RCA (proximal RCA w/ 50% stenosis in distal third) disease; interrogation with pressure wire of LAD lesion revealed non-hemodynamically signficiant lesion. Discharged from SDU on med management (beta blocker, asa, ace, and statin), with f/u w/ Dr. Youmans (who has followed since).
2. Syncope: Admitted twice 2092, first attributed to alpha blocker and dehydration, second time ruled out, but had positive adenosine mibi (see above)
. - 	3. DM2: diagnosed 2080, initially took an oral hypoglycemic agent for 6mo, but since has been managed by diet and exercise only.  HbA1c checked q3mo; most recent was around 5.0 per pt.
4. Hypertension
5. Hypercholesterolemia

ECG: On floor, NSR w/ poor R wave progression (Q waves in V1 an dV2, TWI III), in ED, EKG w/ frequent PACs     

Chest xray: Clear

Assessment & Plan
83 y/o man with known CAD, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia who presents with near syncope, as well as vomiting. Certainly in someone with known CAD, cardiogenic near-syncope is most concerning, namely, MI, with atypical features. However, his EKG is unchanged, his troponins are negative, and he never had chest pain. Perhaps his light-headedness is secondary to bradycardia, as his heart rate has been in the 50s and 60s. However, I think the most likely explanation is that he has a bit of gastroenteritis, was dehydrated, and had a vasovagal response in the setting of exertion. It is worth checking orthostatics given his rigorous blood pressure regimen. There is nothing to suggest seizure or other neurologic etiologies given his story.

Syncope: Stable, no longer feeling dizzy or nauseated
Admit to telemetry and monitor overnight
Has completed MI r/o
Continue ASA, beta blocker, (w/ hold parameters), statin, ACE
Has close follow up w/ Dr. Youmans (next week), and likely does not need repeat stress test while in house
CAD: As above, will d/c on 50 PO Toprol BID per Dr. Youmans    recommendations
Diabetes: Diet controlled at home
RISS while in house with BID fingersticks to assess glucose control
Elevated WBC: Likely 2/2 gastroenteritis. Afebrile. Hemodynamically stable. U/A and chest xray negative
Will send blood cultures and stool cultures if he stools
Fen/Renal
Replete Mg
Proph: Lovenox, nexium

	CARDIOLOGY
	

	PARK NICOLLET CLINIC
	


	Reason for visit:
   55 y/o Columbian male with a history of HTN, hyperlipidemia, severe AS s/p AVR (St. Judes) in 3/17 and recent composite arortic homograft replacement for MRSA/VISA endocarditis presenting for follow-up. 


	Interval History:
   The patient's complicated cardiac history dates back to 3/17 when he underwent mechanical AVR for symptomatic severe AS.  He had preserved LV function and pre-operative cardiac catheterization showed multi vessel non-obstructive CAD.  He initially did well, but had a prolonged hospitalization in 7/17.  At that time, he developed acute cholecystitis and post-ERCP pancreatitis which was complicated by phlegmon and pseudocyst formation.  He was admitted to PNC in 1/18 for elective open cholecystectomy and roux-en-Y cyst-jejunostomy.  He underwent the GI surgery on 1/11/18.  His post-operative course was complicated by recurrent GIB upon re-initiation of anti-coagulation for the mechanical AVR that prolonged his hospital stay. 

Unfortunately, he developed line-associated bactermeia and sepsis 4 weeks into the hospitalization.  He developed high fevers on 2/07/18 ad he had serial cultures positive for MRSA that had intermediate sensitivity to Vancomycin.  He was initially treated with Vancomycin and Gentamicin with addition of Rifampin later in the course of treatment.  He developed progressive PR prolongation on ECG and  a TTE on 2/10/18 and TEE on 2/11/18 showed vegetations on the aortic prosthesis with evidence of annular involvement with abscess.  A follow-up TEE on 2/17/18 showed worsening aortic root abscess and he was ultimately taken to the OR by Dr. Elrod on 2/17/18.  The intraoperative findings were notable were notable for severe aortic root involvement and he underwent composite aortic homograft replacement that was complicated by severe RV failure.  On POD 0, he had recurrent malignant arrhythmias (VT/VF) which required ~ 50 defibrillations and open cardiac massage.  A TEE done after stabilization showed global akinesis and severe TR, and preserved LV function.  Emergent coronary angiogram showed evidence of RCA vasospasm.  An IABP was placed and he was treated with beta blockade and for vasospasm.  HE was taken to the OR for closure on 2/22/18.

His course was subsequently notable for ARF which transiently required CVVH, development of HIT, and vascular emboli to the right lower extremity which led to dry gangrene og the right 3rd digit. ABI testing revealed no evidence of PAD.  He was followed by ID and was placed on daptomycin and Bactrim. He was seen by Vascular surgery and was not deemed to require any surgical intervention and was scheduled for outpatient follow up.  With supportive care, he was successfully weaned off IABP and ventilatory support and transferred to the step down unit.  His course there was notable for mild hyperkalemia that was felt to be related to Bactrim induced RTA. He also had severe depression that was felt to be related an adjustment disorder. He was discharged to a rehab facility on 3/22/18 and was discharged from rehab 12 dyas ago.

Since discharge, he reports doing relatively well. He reports fatigue and DOE after walking up a flight of stairs.  He is able to walk up to 15-20 minutes continuously.  He denies any chest pain, dyspnea at rest, PND, orthopnea, LE edema, palpitations, syncope, or pre-syncope. He also denies any fevers, chills, or weight loss. He has been seen in follow up by Dr. Infant-Nickel in ID earlier this month.  He was noted to be doing relatively well but still had an elevated ESR and CRP.  The plan is continue a prolonged oral taper of Bactrim.  He has completed a 6 week course of daptomycin.


	Past medical history:
   1. MRSA/VISA prosthetic aortic valve endocarditis. Originally underwent AVR for severe AS on 03/13/2117. Developed aortic endocarditis and aortic root abscess as a complication of line sepsis in 2/18 and underwent composite aortic homograft replacement on 2/19/18. Intraoperatively developed severe RV failure.
2. RV failure. Complication of aortic homograft surgery. TEE on 2/20/18 showed severe RV hypokinesis and severe TR.
3. HIT. Developed HIT post-operatively after aortic homograft replacement in 2/18.
4. Coronary artery disease. Preoperative cardiac catheterization on 03/11/2117 demonstrated 30% focal narrowing in the left main; proximal 30% lesion in the LAD; 50% lesion in D1; mid 50% lesion in the left circumflex, and normal RCA. 
5. Dry gangrene of right 3rd digit of right foot thought to be secondary to an embolic complication of IABP versus HITT.
6. Hypertension. 
7. Hyperlipidemia.

	Assessment and plan:
   55 y/o Columbian male with a history of HTN, hyperlipidemia, severe AS s/p AVR (St. Judes) in 3/17 and recent composite arortic homograft replacement for MRSA/VISA endocarditis. The patient had a prolonged hospitalization with a complicated post-operative course that was notable for RV failure, ARF, HIT, vascular emboli to the right foot, and mild hyperkalemia.  At this point, he appears close to euvolemia by exam and has no evidence of decompensated CHF. HE has evidence of severe TR on exam. From an ID perspective although all recent cultures have been negative, the resistance pattern of his MRSA and persistent elevation of ESR and CRP are concerning, and he will require a prolonged course of anti-biotics as outlined by Dr. Infant-Nickel.  His ARF has resolved and his vascular embolic events to the right foot are not an active, acute issue as he only has dry gangrene and no evidence of infection.

1. PVE endocarditis.  He is s/p composite aortic homograft replacement. He will need a prolonged Bactrim taper per ID. We will obtain CBC, chem panel, LFTs, ESR, CRP per ID today. He is currently on coumadin and will likely need this for a total of ~6-8 weeks post-operatively.  We will continue coumadin pending his visit with Dr. Elrod next week.
2. RV failure.  Currently well compensated with no evidence of systemic congestion.  We will continue his current dose of lasix.  Dry weight ~175-178 lbs. I will obtain a repeat TTE to reassess RV and TR severity.  We anticipate some recovery of RV function.  
3. ARF. Resolved. We will check a follow up chem panel today.
4. Right foot gangrene. Involvement of the right 3rd toe with no wet gangrene or signs of infection.  ABI testing in 3/18 showed no PAD.  He will need outpatient follow up with Dr. Werner in vascular surgery.
5. CAD. Non-obstructive disease.  Continue ASA, atenolol and lipitor.  We will hold on ACE-inhibitor given hyperkalemia issues.
6. Hyperkalemia.  Likely secondary to RTA related to Bactrim.  Ww will check follow up chem panel today.  He will need monitoring of K and we can consider kayexlate therapy if he has persistent elevations for the duration of therapy with Bactrim.   

Patient will return to clinic in 3 months for follow-up. Patient seen with Dr. Calhoun.

Reason for Visit	

Mr. Whitehead is here for FU of his many issues.





Problems	  

benign prostatic hypertrophy	      

PSA was 2.9 in 8/69 and 3.2 in 8/70 and 3.0 in 2/72.   He has done well on flomax and now sees Dr. Pena.



hyperlipidemia	      

now on lipitor 40 mg qhs.  He has NIDDM and HTN.  His lipid profile from 4/71 showed a LDL of 103.  LFT were normal.  Will check lab  work and continue med.  

Elevated blood sugar	      

BS was 191 in 11/1/69 and was in similar range during his hospitalization in Montreal Medical.  He has been on meds for NIDDM.  He could not tolerate high dose of glucophage and has seen Dr. Lozano in diabetic unit.  His HBA1c was 7.5 in 6/71 and 7.6 in 9/71 on glyburide 5 mg bid and glucophage XR 500 mg qd.   He is on zestoretic.  Little rationale to check for microalbuminuria as he is already on ace-inh.  His lipids are controlled with diet and lipitor.  He has no neuropathic sx's and sees ophtho regularly.  

HYPERTENSION	      

Now on zestoretic 20/25 bid + atenolol 50 mg qd.  He has significant white coat component.  BP is again 145/80 and is lower at home.  Pulse is 70 but it again sped up when he was being examined.



LOW BACK PAIN	      

he had prolonged discogenic back pain in 1/2070 and could not get appt with NAMG orthopedic/back surgeon and went to Montreal Medical Center.  He underwent L4/5 lamenictomy in 2/2070.  He has persistent right-lower back pain and has seen Drs. Conley and Sheehan.  A myleogram done on 8/5/71 showed degenerative disc disease with moderate spinal stenosis at L4/5.  He continues to have chronic low back pain in the right hip and right anterior thigh.  He exercises regularly and has not benefitted from prior epidural injection.  Dr. Sheehan felt that pain may be from some instability vs scar tissue from prior surgery.  Fusion surgery was discussed but Mr. Whitehead is not too keen on it. [12/25/71]



still has back pain but not ready for fusion surgery yet.

HOSPITAL COURSE: 


PAF/ Flutter: In the Ed, he had been given IV lopressor 5mg  w/ 25mg PO lopressor w/o improvement and then was given 10mg IV dilt which brought HR down to 90s. He was also given 0.5mg digoxin for possible dig load. Given he was failing on Toprol 100mg BID his medications were switched to diltiazem 60mg q6hr to see if a different drug class might help. Cardiology/ EP was consulted for the possibility of ablation given this was his third admission and he is so symptomatic. EP decided to start the patient on sotalol 80-mg BID with the plan to increase sotalol to 120mg BID on 6/15 if Qtc remains stable ( &lt;500 msec). He is planned to received 5 doses of sotalol prior to dispo and if he remained in aflutter through 6/15 is to get DCCV on 6/16. He received his first and only dose in the pm 6/14. Overnight he was bradycardic into the 40s while sleeping. He had a 3.5 second pause however on telemetry. His heart rates have ranged from 45-60 in AFlutter. BPs 90s systolic. Per EP, as pt asleep, will con't sotalol. He is on coumadin for anticoagulation. INR goal 2-3. EP(Dr. Moody= fellow) and cards (PRM wright) are following. 


PUMP: echo 04/84 which demonstrated an elongated LA sLVH, EF 61%, tr TR, RSVP 41, RV nl. On ACEI.

						RE:  Tyler Pearson

					                    WMC#727-19-02



Dear Doctor Trejo:



I had the pleasure of seeing our mutual patient, Mr. Tyler Pearson, in follow up evaluation in our vascular surgery clinic here today.  As you will remember he recently underwent right carotid endarterectomy with Dacron patch angioplasty after treatment of a severe underlying pneumonia.  He returns today reporting that he is doing well from a neurologic standpoint.  He has had no focal, motor, sensory deficits, and no amaurosis fugax.  A follow up duplex examination performed in our vascular laboratory reveals mild right ICA disease after his carotid endarterectomy with moderate left ICA stenosis which should be followed over time.  



Assessment and plan:  Overall, I am extremely pleased with Mr. Pearson's outcome given his high risk pulmonary status.  It would be prudent to see him again in follow up evaluation in six months' time with a repeat carotid duplex examination.  I would be happy to assist in the management of this or any of your other patients as you deem necessary in the future.  Thank you again for allowing me to assist in his care.  If I can be of any further assistance, please feel free to contact either myself or one of my partners directly.



						Sincerely,







						Steven E. Land, M.D.

INTERNAL MEDICINE ASSOCIATES

HOLDEN DISTRICT HOSPITAL



Reason for visit   Three months of followup for multiple medical problems.



History of present illness   Since his last visit, he has started to resume exercising on his treadmill, but has not been watching his weight or diet.



Major Problems

Hyperlipidemia

His most recent labs are within reasonable range with an LDL of 76 and fasting triglycerides 263, which improved from his previous values.  He has been intolerant to Lopid which resulted in pancreatitis.  He has not lost any weight, but has begun to exercise.

Allergic rhinitis

He has chronic postnasal drip and nasal congestion for which he uses Nasonex on a regular basis with some improvement.  He has had no sinus pains, headache, or recent sinusitis.

Cerebrovascular accident

The patient has had no recent neurological symptoms or changes.  He had a mild aphasia which has totally resolved.  He has had no headaches or any focal symptoms.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease

The patient continues on his ranitidine at night with improvement in his intermittent epigastric discomfort.

Sleep apnea

The patient had a sleep study in November 2091 due to excessive fatigue and snoring.  He was noted to have sleep apnea, and CPAP was prescribed.  He has not been using the CPAP since he was recently on vacation, but he plans to start in the near future.  During his sleep study, he was not uncomfortable wearing the mask and hopefully, this will help.

Prostatic carcinoma

The patient is followed regularly by the urologist and last had a visit in January 2092 with PSA in a very good range at less than 0.2.  He has no dysuria, urgency, frequency, or significant nocturia.

Carpal tunnel syndrome

Currently, he does not complain of any pain or paresthesias in his wrists.

Coronary artery disease

The patient has had no angina since his last visit.  He exercises on a treadmill five times a week and can walk up to five miles in any given setting.  He does not have any palpitations, chest pressure, pain, or significant dyspnea on exertion.

Diabetes mellitus

The patient checks his blood sugars at home, and they have been in the 120 range, although he admits to not losing weight and on his recent trip was not exercising as regularly.  He has had no symptoms with hypoglycemia.

Hypertension

The patient monitors his blood pressure closely at home and finds it to be at around 120/70.  He has not had any headaches or any other focal symptoms.

Cor   Normal S1 and S2.  Regular rhythm.  No murmurs, gallops, or rubs

Abdomen   Obese and nontender

Extrem   No clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.  Distal pulses, dorsalis pedis, and posterior tibial are full and symmetrical

Foot exam   No evidence of skin lesions

Neuro   Grossly nonfocal.  Speech fluent without paraphasic errors.  Memory, excellent and intact.  Gait normal



Assessment and plan   The patient's multiple issues were reviewed in detail and his medications were updated.  He remains overweight, and this was discussed with the patient in terms of portion control and continuing his vigorous exercise program.  He will try to lose weight.

Diabetes.  His last hemoglobin A1c was not in adequate control.  In the past, we have tried to increase his Glucophage.  He did not tolerate it due to severe GI upset.  If his sugars remain high, he will need his regimen adjusted.  His eye exam and throat exam are up-to-date and urine for microalbumin was negative.

Coronary artery disease.  No recent angina.  He will continue on his current regimen.

Sleep apnea.  It was highly recommended that he start his CPAP therapy for overall improvement in his health.

Hypertension.  Very well controlled, and no side effects to his current medications.  Laboratory studies were sent, and he will return for followup in three months or sooner if needed.



Addendum   Allergies were reviewed.

North East, AL 81699                            58269151

(375) 512-0897                                            01/22/77





HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. Xia is a 57-year-old woman who comes in for evaluation of treatment of diabetes and hypertension, reporting that for the last 3 days she has had trouble with her vision, her blood pressure has been high.  She has been having a lot of headaches.  She has had pain in her right thumb that goes to her right lateral side area.  She has been having hot flashes but no fevers, sweats or chills.  Her sugars have been okay in the 99-120 range, the highest was about 135-140.  She does not really understand why she is feeling so bad with these headaches and other problems.



REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Conducted in detail and was otherwise negative.



MEDICATIONS:  She has not taken any medications for the last two days.  She does have her diabetes medications but no blood pressure medication.  She usually takes Cozaar 100 daily, Glucophage 1000 b.i.d., Glucotrol XL 5 daily, Lipitor 20 daily, Norvasc 10 daily.  She has not been needing Nexium of late.



ALLERGIES:  Clonidine caused sleepiness and codeine rash.



SOCIAL HISTORY:  She does not smoke or use street drugs.  She does have a little bit of white wine when she has guests on occasion.



PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On exam, well developed, well nourished, no acute distress.  Blood pressure 152/120, pulse 76, temperature 97.2, weight 166.  Pleasant, articulate in English, she appears comfortable.  Pupils equal, equally reactive to light.  Retinal fields have sharp disks.  Mouth and pharynx without erythema or exudate, no adenopathy or tenderness in the submandibular, cervical, posterior cervical, supraclavicular areas.  Thyroid nontender, non-nodular.  Neck supple, no spine or flank tenderness.  No bruits, no stridor.  Heart sounds S1, S2, regular rate and rhythm, no murmur, rub or gallop.  Chest is clear to auscultation anteriorly and posteriorly with no rales, wheezes or rhonchi.  She is clear to percussion.  Normal bowel sounds.  Abdomen soft, nontender, no mass, organomegaly, no guarding, no rebound.  Extremities are without edema, cyanosis or clubbing, no calf tenderness.  Sensation is intact to microfilament testing bilaterally on her feet.  Pedal pulses are present.  Feet are warm.  There is no rash, maceration, or lesion on her feet.



LABORATORY DATA:  Hemoglobin A1c from October was 7.2.  LDL from last May was 164.



IMPRESSION AND PLAN:

1.  Diabetes.  Her diabetes has been near goal.  We will recheck glucose, hemoglobin A1c, UA, and microalbuminuria and see how she is doing today.

2.  Elevated cholesterol.  Her cholesterol was nowhere near our target of 100.  She is on an increased Lipitor.  We will check cholesterol, see how she is doing at this point, and an OT, PT to make sure she is tolerating the medication.

3.  Hypertension.  All of her symptoms today are most likely due to her hypertension.  I explained at great length that the reason for all of her symptoms is the fact she stopped taking her medication.  She seemed surprised that it would have such an immediate and strong effect and I explained to her that it does.  She has to take her medication every day.  I told her she had to leave the Carolyn Huntington right now, go immediately to the drugstore to pick up the medication and she said she would do that.  I also asked her to return next week so we can recheck her blood pressure and make sure it is controlled.

4.  Health maintenance.  I will schedule her for a mammogram.

5.  Colonic adenoma from 11/2076.  She will need follow-up colonoscopy every three years per GI.

Assessment: 58 year-old man with a history of CAD CHF, and OSA who presents with weakness, weight loss, SOB, and ARF in the setting of increased diuretic use.   



Plan:

1.	ARF: 

-responding to slow hydration, will aim for euvolemia and hold diuresis and ACE-I. Gentle IVF at this time given tenuous balance between being dry and volume overloaded, will reassess volume status in the AM along with AM lytes

-hold lasix, ACE-I

-Urine lytes obtained in the ED difficult to interpret in the setting of diuretic use

-check Urine Eos (per attg)

-Renal U/S (per attg)

-treat UTI (levoflox x 10 D), f/u UCx

2.	HTN

-continue lopressor, hold Cartia XT and Altace

3.	SOB: Expected improvement in symptoms with diuresis but patient actually reports worsening of SOB.  Last ECHO demonstrated normal RSVP but concern now for progressive primary pulmonary process contributing to R heart failure not L sided dysfunction.

-repeat ECHO in the AM 

4.	DM

-holding metformin in the setting of ARF

-half home NPH dose with SSI

5.	CAD

-hold lipitor given renal failure,

-continue ASA, toprol, 

6.	Dispo

-Return to home

Reason for visit

			

  Followup of multiple issues.



History of present illness

			

  Since his last visit, the patient has had two episodes of pressure in his chest.  This occurred approximately one week ago in the setting of walking up the stairs and carrying a heavy package.  He notes that his pulse went up to 101 and he had overall felt ""tired in his chest"".  He did not take any nitroglycerine, and his symptoms promptly resolved.  He has continued to notice episodes of intermittent rapid pulses with pulses up to 100.  He has had no syncope or near syncope.  Generally, he has been walking on the treadmill up to four to six miles a day several times a week.  Over the last few weeks, he has felt a little bit more fatigued and now can only walk approximately four miles.  He has not had any sustained palpitation, syncope, or near syncope, but has noted a slight decrease in his exercise tolerance.

Assessment and plan

			

  The patient's symptoms and exam as well as EKG are consistent with atrial fibrillation.  Of note, the patient had a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation after his CABG.  However, he has not had any significant symptoms since that time.  He remains active without any evidence of congestive heart failure on exam.  He continues to exercise on a regular basis.  Given his slightly elevated pulse rate, his atenolol will be increased to 25 mg PO BID from one per day which is what he is currently taking.  His blood pressure is under good control.  Given his recent episode of repeat stress test will be sent.  If there is any prolonged episode of pain, he will come to the emergency room immediately.  He is encouraged to use nitroglycerine sublingually if he has any evidence or any chest pressure.  For his diabetes, his labs will be sent.  He remains on Coumadin for anticoagulation, and his INR has been therapeutic.  He will follow up in three months but sooner pending the above evaluation.  If he has any increase in his symptoms, he will be admitted immediately.

Internal Medicine Intern Admission Note



Patient Name:  REBECCA YAGER

MR#:  0887181

Date of Admission:  4/11/96

Attending:  Dr. Georgia Xing

Intern:  Branden Ocasio



ID/CC:    There's a herd of elephants on my chest.    



HPI: 	69 yo F with PMH of DM, HTN, s/p MI one year ago, now presents with substernal chest pain and increased shortness of breath x 2 days.  Patient was in her usual state of health until 3 days prior to admission, when she began experiencing unremitting substernal chest pain, nonradiating.  This pain was constant,    24 hours/day   , and    felt like a herd of elephants on my chest.     This was accompanied by an increased shortness of breath, especially with exertion, which the patient had not experienced before.  The chest pain and shortness of breath would wake her up at night, accompanied by drenching sweats and a dizziness,    I felt like I was about to faint.     Patient sleeps with two pillows at baseline.  The pain eventually grew to be so severe that the patient called EMS.  Upon their arrival at her house she was given 2 doses of SL nitro which improved her pain.  



In the TPG ED her vital signs were Temp AF, HR 70, BP 154/79, RR 20, satting 99% RA.  EKG showed a new Twave inversion in V3, otherwise at her baseline normal EKG.  IV heparin was started for possible MI given her symptoms and history.  D-dimer was elevated at 782. Based on these findings and her shortness of breath, PE-CT was obtained, which was negative for PE.  However, it did show multiple new mediastinal lymph nodes up to 9mm in size, as well as a 6mm nodule in the LLL.  The patient was given ASA, MSO4, nitro, and made chest pain free in the ED.  She was admitted for continued rule out for MI and workup of her pulmonary findings.  



ROS:  No fevers/chills. Does report cough, cold sores x 1 week.  The patient did report having slight lower quadrant abdominal pain, with some nausea but no vomiting, No hematochezia/melena. No increased frequency, no dysuria. No delta MS/LOC.

RADIOLOGY



Chest CT:  4/11/96

	No gross filling defect is noted in the pulmonary arteries to

	suggest pulmonary embolism.  There are several mediastinal lymph

	nodes measuring slightly less than 1 cm in size.  However, in the

	region of the AP window there are numerous AP window lymph nodes

	measuring approximately 9 mm in short axis.  These could be

	reactive or neoplastic.  There is a less than 1 cm left hilar

	node.  In the posterior left lower lobe there is a 6 mm

	parenchymal nodule. This is best demonstrated on image 65. This

	could possibly represent a malignancy.  Alternatively this could

	represent an intraparenchymal lymph node.  This does not appear to

	touch the pleural surface and rounded atelectasis would seem less

	likely.  Some scarring and volume loss is noted in the medial

	right lung base.  There is no pneumothorax.  No significant

	pleural fluid is noted.  There is no pericardial fluid.

IMPRESSION:

	No pulmonary embolism or DVT.  There are multiple mediastinal

	lymph nodes as well as a 6 mm nodule in the left lower lobe.

	Neoplasm cannot be excluded.  A follow-up chest CT may be further

	value.  These findings were discussed with Dr. Hendricks at the time

	of dictation.



EKG:  NSR, compared to prior there is new flipped T wave in III, however no ST/T wave abnormalities, no evidence of infarction.



A/P:

Pt is a 69 yo F with PMH notable for DM, HTN, peripheral neuropathy and s/p MI with multiple admissions for rule out, who presents with chest pain, shortness of breath, nightsweats, dizziness, and new mediastinal lymphadenopathy with a lung nodule not noted on prior chest X-rays.  This constellation of symptoms may be viewed in several different ways:  from a cardiac standpoint, as presentation of unstable angina, given her hx of MI and cardiac risk factors; from an oncological standpoint, as a pheochromocytoma or carcinoid syndrome, given the sympathomimetic nature of her symptoms such as dizziness, abd pain/nausea, chest pain and dyspnea, and the findings in Ab CT and Chest CT, or a primary lung cancer given her history of smoking; from an infectious disease standpoint, as possible reactivation tuberculosis, given that she has a history of TB infection and treatment.  I believe the priority of the differential should be granted to the oncologic and infectious etiologies, given that she appears to be ruling out for an MI, has little to no ischemic changes on EKG, and is chest pain free with continued exacerbation of her shortness of breath and sweating.  Workup should proceed in the direction of ruling out TB, and establishing the nature of the pulmonary nodule and mediastinal lymphadenopathy.



CV:

--Rate:  well controlled without medication. 

--Rhythm:  normal sinus

--Pump:  On ACEI, HCTZ for HTN.  

--ischemia:  on ASA/statin.  Rule out for MI with CMs x 3.  Will obtain stress test in AM.  

  

PULM:  

--plant PPD

--send sputum cultures, consider adding AFB.

--send ANCA

--follow up CT for nodule

--nebs/O2 therapy to support breathing



ENDO:

--urine metanephrines for pheo

--5HIAA metabolites for carcinoid

--TSH

--AB-CT for evolution of adenoma

--holding metformin, will control with SSIR.



Prophy

--Nexium

--holding on fragmin for now-low threshold to resume for DVT prophy given possible oncologic diagnosis.

EDVISIT^83288425^PAUL, MAE^04/30/90^CORTES, ODESSA

The patient was seen in conjunction with resident, Dr. Peacock. 

Resident's note was reviewed.  The patient was seen and examined

by me.  Please see the resident's note for details of the

patient's past medical, social, family history, review of

systems, and physical exam.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Bleeding fistula.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 78-year-old woman with

end-stage renal disease, on hemodialysis, who is here with

bleeding of her left upper arm AV fistula that she uses for

dialysis that started today at dialysis.  When the patient pulled

up her sleeve, she scratched herself and it began to bleed. 

Blood pressure is 112/60.  The bleeding can be controlled with

compression and so she presented to the Emergency Department

where she was seen by the Internal Medicine for repair.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  The patient has a history of severe aortic

stenosis with 0.7 cm greater diameter, mitral regurg and

tricuspid regurg, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, PVD,

foot drop, anemia, sciatica, left thigh pain, hyperlipidemia,

secondary hyperparathyroidism, hemorrhoids, coronary artery

disease status post non-ST elevation MI, CHF with an EF of

35-40%.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Includes a TAH, appendectomy, cataract

surgery, ovarian cyst removal.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Never smoked, does not drink or use drugs.  She

is retired, lives with her daughter who is a surgeon.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Shows an extensive vascular history.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Otherwise, negative.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She is afebrile, normal and stable vital

signs.  She has bilaterally faintly scattered rales on chest

examination and she has a small laceration on the left arm over

the fistula with an excoriation and this squirting blood would

not controlled with pressure.

LABORATORY DATA:  CBC is normal with a hematocrit of 43.  Chem-7

is otherwise normal.  Coags reveal an INR of 1.4.  Chest x-ray

shows no acute disease.

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  She was seen by surgery who repair

her fistula.  She is due to go to dialysis now and due to sickle

nature of her disease, I think it is best that she keep her

dialysis appointment and so she is transferred from here with her

daughter to the EHCC Dialysis Unit to undergo full dialysis.

PRIMARY DIAGNOSES:  Bleeding aVF and end-stage renal disease.

DISPOSITION:  She is discharged in satisfactory condition.

Reason for Visit	

FU of several issues



Problems	  

DVT	      

dx with left calf DVT on 3/20/74 in setting of being sedentary from low back pain.  Had face joint block on 3/09/74.  D-dimer was high and cxr was clear.  No respiratory sx's to suggest pulmonary embolism.  HE is on fragmin bid for 3 more days.  INR was 2.5 on 3/23/74 and he is on 2.5 mg qd.  He will be seeing Internal Medicine on 3/28/74.  Will treat him with coumadin for six months.  He has moderate post-phlebitic pain and is on prn percocets.

Elevated blood sugar	      

BS was 191 in 11/1/69 and was in similar range during his hospitalization in Montreal Medical.  He has been on meds for NIDDM.  His glucophage was stopped as his cr was in the 1.5-1.7 range.   He is now on glyburide 10 mg bid and his sugars are still high with fasting levels in the 180-250 range.  



His HBA1c was 7 in 11/73.  Will transition him to insuline with 25 units NPH sc qhs and he will monitor sugars bid and report back to me.



FU in one month to recheck HBA1c. 

benign prostatic hypertrophy	      

PSA was 2.9 in 8/69 and 3.2 in 8/70 and 3.0 in 2/72.   PSA was checked while in hospital by resident in 3/74 and it was 12.9.



Discussed ramification of this test.  Will favor rechecking his PSA in one month.  Due to recent DVT and his being on coumadin, he would not be amenable to undergo prostate biopsy in the next few weeks.  If PSA remains high, will have him see urology.

HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  This patient was examined and 
treated in conjunction with a resident.  Briefly, the history is as 
follows:  The patient is a 47 year old male with end stage renal 
disease on hemodialysis who was referred for abdominal discomfort 
and fever.  His abdominal discomfort had begun within the preceding 
24 hours and had gradually worsened.  He had pain in the left lower 
quadrant radiating to the rectal area.  He did have one diarrheal 
bowel movement.  He specifically denied bleeding. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  GENERAL APPEARANCE:  The patient was awake 
and alert, although somewhat sluggish and apparently uncomfortable. 
VITAL SIGNS:  Blood pressure was 177/90, pulse 117, initial 
temperature 103.3, respiratory rate 20.  HEENT:  Pupils were equal. 
Sclerae were anicteric.  The oropharynx showed normal architecture. 
NECK:  Supple.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  Regular rate and rhythm.  LUNGS: 
The breath sounds were essentially clear.  ABDOMEN:  There was mild 
to moderate diffuse tenderness.  No definite mass can be 
appreciated.  Bowel sounds were diminished.  RECTAL:  Stool is 
guaiac-negative, per the resident's examination.  EXTREMITIES: 
Examination of the left thigh showed slight drainage at a recent 
surgical incision site. 
LABORATORY EVALUATION:  Electrolytes showed sodium 139, potassium 
4.3, chloride 99, CO2 27, BUN 12, creatinine 2.2, glucose 230. 
White blood cell count was 30,000, hematocrit 38.  Chest x-ray 
showed no definite infiltrate.  Abdominal x-ray showed dilated 
loops of small bowel.  EKG showed no change from previous tracings. 
THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  The assessment and plan were 
reviewed with the resident. 
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  I confirm the provisional diagnosis of abdominal 
pain with question of deep venous thrombosis versus sepsis from as 
yet unidentified source. 
DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  The care plan 
was reviewed.  The patient was started on antibiotics and 
ultimately admitted to the hospital for definitive evaluation and 
further care.

Internal Medicine - MSIII Admission Note



Pt: Crawford, Patrick (Mary 3562Z)

MR#: 	902-15-55

Date of Admission: 10/10/92

Attending: 	Yancey, Ursula

PCP: Estep, Willa

Code status: Full





CC:  Generalized weakness + diaphoresis



HPI:  Pt is an 82 yo man with a history of diet-controlled DM2, HTN, and a syncopal episode 1mo ago who presents with an episode of profuse diaphoresis and generalized weakness while cooking in his home at 10am this morning.  He had recently returned home from grocery shopping, carrying 6 bags of groceries up 1 flight to his apartment, and was moving about his kitchen cooking when he felt suddenly drenched in sweat.  He immediately felt lightheaded, disoriented, nauseous, generally weak, and as though he was about to faint.  He was able to walk a few steps, sit down, and rest for 15-20min before he realized his symptoms weren't resolving, called his sister, and put his head on the table and felt he could not really move because he was so weak.  He denied any CP, SOB, palpitations, flushes, fever/chills, HA, visual changes, vomiting, and focal weakness associated with the episode.  He felt he had been drinking adequate fluids, had no recent infections/cough/rhinorrhea, had no weight loss, and no exposures.  When his sister arrived he told her to call 911, and soon he was brought to the SOH ED.



One month PTA, Mr. Crawford had been in his usual state of health when he had his first ever feeling of lightheadedness and diaphoresis while grocery shopping.  Five minutes later while getting into his car, he had increasing lightheadedness and lost consciousness, falling to the ground with no head trauma.  As with today's episode, he denied prior CP, SOB, palpitations and other symptoms previously listed.  According to his sisters who were present at the time, he regained consciousness 2 minutes later, and he recalls knowing exactly where he was but not what had happened to him.  He did not lose continence of bladder or bowel.  He was brought to the ED, where his vitals were stable with a BP of 126/61 and HR 66, and was admitted for observation and workup.  Head CT was negative for an acute process, CXR was clear, EKG showed some LA enlargement and mild ST / Twave changes consistent with an EKG of 2yrs ago, negative cardiac enzymes, and a cardiac echo showing mild MR, an elongated LA, and an EF of 68%.  At the time of discharge he was instructed to stop taking Prazosin for his BPH and instead take Flomax.



In the past month, Mr. Crawford has had no repeat syncopal episodes, but many episodes of diaphoresis with very mild lightheadedness.  He reports that at least every few days he either has a brief diaphoresis episode during his daily activities, or sometimes a profuse diaphoresis that can occur while lying in bed and causing him to change his clothes and bedsheets.  He has had no other symptoms.  Of note, this morning he had run out of Flomax due to an insurance issue, and resumed taking 4mg of leftover Prazosin for his BPH around 6am.  He disliked the Flomax because it seemed to cause polyuria and generally made him feel 'off' in an unidentifiable way.  Currently the pt feels slightly lightheaded/'woozy', sometimes worse with positional changes, and still generally weak, with no other symptoms.



PMH: 	- DM2: diagnosed 2080, initially took an oral hypoglycemic agent for 6mo, but since has been managed by diet and exercise only.  HbA1c checked q3mo; most recent was around 5.0 per pt.

_____________________________________________________________________________________



Impression:  Pt is an 82 yo man with a h/o DM2, HTN, and a syncopal episode 1mo ago p/w diaphoresis and generalized weakness 15min after moderate activity.  Episode occurred in setting of frequent diaphoresis episodes in the past 1mo, and with medication change from Flomax to Prazosin this morning 4hrs prior to current episode.  No LOC, CP, SOB, or seizure-like activity.  No focal deficits and non-orthostatic on exam with strength intact.  Stable Hct.  Likely etiologies include:



1.	Arrhythmia, including sick sinus.  EKGs demonstrate mild LA enlargement, old V1/V2 Q waves.  Could predispose to atrial fib or conduction abnormalities.  Sick sinus not seen on EKG, but common cause of pre-syncope.



2.	Vertebrobasilar/Carotid stenosis.  Basilar territory could lead to dizziness; would expect more focal findings if carotid etiology, unless bilateral blockage.



3.	Prazosin-induced hypotension.  In light of very recent change back to Prazosin, which has more vascular/peripheral alpha-1 antagonism than does the more prostate-specific Flomax, could result in cerebral hypoperfusion.



4.	Neurocardiogenic/Carotid hypersensitivity.





Plan:



Pre-syncope:	- ROMI with 2nd and 3rd set of cardiac markers

		- Telemetry

		- 24 hr Holter monitor

		- Carotid Doppler and Posterior Transcranial Doppler

		- Check lytes, CBC + diff in a.m.

		- IVF: NS 500cc at 75cc/hr

		- Continue Lisinopril, HCTZ but discontinue Prazosin as inpatient

		- ASA qod as at home, consider    qd



DM2:		- Check glucose in a.m.

		- No insulin requirement; order diabetic diet



OA:		- Motrin 400mg bid; check BUN/Cr and U/A for evidence of AIN or ATN



Gout:		- Continue Allopurinol



Optho:		- Continue home regimen of Truopt, Artificial tears, etc.

YARBROUGH,IRENE   810-86-43-7                        VISIT DATE: 10/13/78
PRESENTING COMPLAINT and HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  The 
patient is a 54-year-old female seen by Dr. Paulson and also by the 
Oncology service.  Briefly, this is a 54-year-old female with a 
known mass in her vagina, who presents now with vaginal bleeding. 
The patient was seen earlier yesterday by the Oncology service, 
and is scheduled to have surgery for the mass to be removed, but 
she developed significant vaginal bleeding and presented to the 
Emergency Department today.  She is otherwise healthy.  Her first 
time seen in the Emergency Department or seen by Oncology was two 
weeks ago for increased bleeding.  She was diagnosed at the time 
with a necrotic fibroid, and was confirmed by studies to have a 
large fibroid at that time.  She now presents with increasing 
weakness and light-headedness and more bleeding. 
THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  In the Emergency Department, an IV 
was started, and laboratory studies sent, including CBC, 
electrolytes, PT/PTT, and she was also typed and crossed and a 
urinalysis sent.  A chest x-ray and EKG were sent.  The patient was 
made n.p.o.  She is a preoperative patient.  Her initial hematocrit 
here was 23.  A full note was written by the Oncology service, 
and she is currently admitted to that service. 
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  Vaginal bleeding with necrotic leiomyoma. 
DISPOSITION (including condition on discharge):  As above.  The 
patient's condition on admission is stable.

	Reason for visit:

   consulted by Dr Dunham for continuity of care s/p cabg



	Interval History:

   This 53 yo male was referred with DM and CAD who today underwent CABG and CEA with Dr Dunham. Specifically he had: CABG x 3;  LIMA: Pedicle (IMA) to LAD-Mid Saphenous Vein: Ascending Aorta to Diagonal-2nd Saphenous Vein: Ascending Aorta to Diagonal-3rd; Coronary Endarterectomy.



He was in his USOH until several months ago when he first noticed lower extremity edema and activity intolerance. Symptoms waxed and waned, but eventually progressed so he was experiencing daily SOB and fatigue with usual daily activities such as walking or working around his home, and worsening LE edema up to his knees. He sought evaluation from his PCP 3 weeks ago was and found to have severe cardiomyopathy with LVEF of 25% on stress-MIBI. There was global hypokinesis. Perfusion images suggest a small distal anteroapical scar and moderately dilated LV (both new since 2076). There was no definite evidence of ischemia, although it is noted the patient was unable to achieve 85% MPHR due to poor activity tolerance. 



He was started on Coreg, as well as Lasix which has been uptitrated from 20 to 60mg qd, with subsequent 12-14 lbs weight loss. His lower extremity edema is markedly improved, and activity tolerance is moderately improved. He can perform basic ADLs such as dressing and bathing without difficulty. Walking, especially inclines, climbing stairs, and carrying parcels will cause SOB. He still feels fatigued throughout the day. He has no orthopnea, PND, abdominal distension, early satiety, abdominal pain or anorexia. He reports BPs are much improved with the addition of Coreg, even as they are running 130-150s/80-100. 



	Past medical history:

   1. DCM, diagnosed 7/81. 

2. HTN, long standing, poorly controlled.

Habits: Denies any history of tobacco use. Although he denied illicit drug use, his chart review revealed above noted history of cocaine abuse. He subsequently admitted to prior use, i.e. at parties while traveling. He denies related excessive ETOH use, use of other illicit drugs, or high risk sexual behaviors. He admits to 3 drinks per week currently. 



	Review of systems:

   As detailed in HPI. He has never had chest pain or pressure, palpitations, irregular heartbeat, presyncope, or syncope. He denies having had fever, chills, or acute viral illness preceding onset of symptoms, recent travel out of the country or history of tick bites, hepatitis, or TB. He has no known thyroid problems.

	OAKLAND ASSOCIATES CENTER

	



	Interval History:

   This 63 y/o male patient with a h/o HTN, HLP, non-revascularized 4-vessel CAD, preserved LV systolic function, PAD with past PTA and stenting to the R EIA and distal L SFA, tobacco abuse, type 2 DM, peripheral neuropathy, L ulnar nerve compression, ulcerative colitis, GERD, depressive disorder, anxiety disorder, and gouty arthritis presents to the OAC Cath Lab this morning for a scheduled elective peripheral arterial catheterization procedure.  The patient was last seen in outpatient vascular medicine follow-up by Dr. Levi Barton at the OAC 04/09/2078, at which time he reported recurrent and persistent BLE claudication symptoms, RLE > LLE, with pain in his buttocks, thighs, and calves with ambulation.  He reports that these symptoms, coupled with his peripheral neuropathy symptoms, have become quite debilitating and lifestyle-limiting.  The patient denies any chronic or poorly-healing ulcers or sores on his feet or lower extremities.  Given his history and symptomatic complaints, Dr. Barton recommended that the patient be scheduled to undergo an elective peripheral arteriogram to re-assess his PAD and, if indicated and feasible, to pursue percutaneous revascularization.  The patient had previously undergone a peripheral angiogram at the OAC on 11/21/2077, performed by Dr. Barton, which culminated in PTA and stenting to the R EIA and the distal L SFA, the former with a balloon-expandable biliary stent and the latter with a self-expanding biliary stent.  Follow-up lower extremity non-invasive studies performed at the OAC in 01/2078 revealed a depressed resting ABI of 0.70 in the RLE, which dropped to 0.24 following exercise (as well as a resting ABI of 1.00 in the LLE which decreased to 0.50 post-exercise).  The patient has not been treated with Pletal in the past.  An important side note is the fact that the patient's diagnostic LHC procedure at the OAC in 10/2077 revealed significant 4-vessel CAD, which for some reason was treated medically rather than surgically or percutaneously.  The patient has expressed a desire to have his coronary arteries re-assessed by angiography during today's peripheral catheterization procedure, not particularly because of any recurrent CP but mostly out of concern that his CAD may have worsened and because he may undergo surgery for his L ulnar nerve compression in the relatively near future. 



	Past medical history:

   1.   Hypertension (managed with chronic beta-blocker and ACE-inhibitor medications).

2.   Hyperlipidemia (managed with a chronic ""statin"" medication).

3.   Coronary Artery Disease (4-vessel disease noted during the 10/2077 LHC procedure, with no past percutaneous or surgical revascularization procedures).

4.   Preserved Left Ventricular Systolic Function (EF estimated at 65% by LV-gram during the LHC at the OAC in 10/2077).

5.   Peripheral Artery Disease (involving the BLEs, with PTA and stenting to both the distal L SFA and the R EIA at the OAC in 11/2077).

6.   Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (HgbA1c 8.2% on 06/27/2078;  treated with OHAs).

7.   Peripheral Neuropathy (per the patient;  being treated with Neurontin).

8.   Left Ulnar Nerve Compression (seen by Dr. Ryan and considering surgical treatment).

9.   Ulcerative Colitis (treated effectively with Prednisone during exacerbations).

10.   Gastro-Esophageal Reflux Disease (treated with a chronic PPI medication).

11.   Gouty Arthritis (infrequent exacerbations;  no chronic uricosuric pharmacotherapy).

12.   Depressive Disorder (treated with chronic pharmacotherapy).

13.   Anxiety Disorder (treated with benzodiazepine pharmacotherapy).

14.   Tobacco Abuse (35 pack-year history, with cessation 5 months ago).

Duplex U/S also revealed revealed significantly elevated blood flow velocities in the proximal L PFA (PSV 306 cm/sec), as well as moderately elevated velocities in the proximal-to-mid L SFA (PSV 191 cm/sec).  Findings consistent with hemodynamically significant PAD of the BLEs.    



	Assessment and plan:

   ASSESSMENT:

63 y/o male patient with a h/o HTN, HLP, non-revascularized 4-vessel CAD, preserved LV systolic function, PAD with past PTA and stenting to the R EIA and distal L SFA, tobacco abuse, type 2 DM, peripheral neuropathy, L ulnar nerve compression, ulcerative colitis, GERD, depressive disorder, anxiety disorder, and gouty arthritis who presents to the OAC Cath Lab today for the purpose of undergoing a scheduled elective peripheral arterial catheterization procedure because of recurrent BLE claudication symptoms (RLE > LLE).  In addition, a diagnostic coronary angiogram will most likely be performed as well, particularly because of the patient's known unrevascularized multi-vessel CAD and the likelihood that he may undergo surgery in the relatively near future for his L ulnar nerve compression.  The patient is presently asymptomatic at rest, hemodynamically stable, in sinus rhythm, well-oxygenated on room air, in no distress, and ready to proceed with his scheduled elective catheterization procedure today.





PLAN:

1.   Proceed with the planned catheterization procedure this morning, which will include coronary angiography and BLE peripheral angiography (+/- possible percutaneous revascularization).

2.   Informed written consent obtained from the patient (by one of the peripheral vascular interventional fellow) pre-procedure this morning.

3.   No pre-medication for renal and/or allergy prophylaxis appears clinically warranted prior to angiography.

4.   Admit the patient to the OAC on the inpatient service of Dr. Barton post-procedure.

5.   Continue the patient on his same prior regimen and doses of ECASA, Plavix, Toprol-XL, Lisinopril, and Zocor.  

6.   Continue holding the patient's prior Metformin for 48 hours following contrast administration during angiography today.

7.   Monitor the patient's FSBG values and covering with sliding scale regular insulin as needed for episodes of hyperglycemia.

8.   Continue the patient on Glipizide, a PPI (Prilosec in place of his usual Protonix while at the OAC [formulary limitations]), Neurontin, Effexor, Chantix, Hytrin, and Vitamin-B12.

9.   Lab testing tomorrow morning should include the following:   CBC, Chem-7, Mg, CPKs, HS-CRP, Lipoprotein(a), and Homocysteine.

10.   Discharge timing will depend upon today's procedural findings and events, the patient's peri- and post-catheterization course, and the potential need for further monitoring, testing, or treatment in the inpatient setting.

11.   Following his hospital discharge, the patient should see Dr. Barton in outpatient vascular medicine follow-up in approximately 4 - 6 weeks, with follow-up lower extremity non-invasive studies (particularly resting and post-exercise ABIs) at that time.

12.   Will re-address with Dr. Barton the need to consider the patient's need for coronary arterial revascularization, either percutaneously or surgically, given the severity and multi-vessel involvement.

13.   Further plans and recommendations as per Dr. Barton.

CHIEF COMPLAINT
: 
hyperglycemia






HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS





            Mr. Slater is an 83 yo w/ h/o bullous pemphigoid, chronic kidney disease, HTN, dyslipidemia, and multiple vasculopathies presenting with hyperglycemia.  His dermatologist started prednisone (60 mg daily) three weeks ago for a pemphigiod flair.  Mr Slater&#8217;s sugars were initially well controlled off insulin, but a week and a half ago he began to develop lower extremity edema, DOE, and general fatigue.  He began to taper the prednisone (to 40 mg daily) and then stopped them altogether yesterday.  He presented to the FPC ED complaining of fatigue and weakness and was found to have a FSBG&gt;500.  His initial labs were notable for a glucose of 804.  An EKG showed a-fib (rate 70s).  His blood pressure, oxygenation, and respiratory were the normal range and he was given 2 L of NS and regular insulin.  Repeat labs showed Glu 479 w/ partial resolution of other electrolyte abnormalities.  He was admitted to the hospital for further evaluation and management.

            On arrival to the floor, he reports feeling tired, but that his weakness and fatigue have improved since he arrived in the ED.  He continues to have LE edema, which has worsened in the last day.  He denies recent weight loss, fevers, cough, dyspnea or PND, syncope, N/V, diarrhea, constipation, melena, urinary symptoms, joint pain, bruising, worsening rash, skin lesions, double vision, dysarthria, headache, or focal weakness or numbness.

A/P
: Mr. Slater is an 83 yo w/ h/o bullous pemphigoid, chronic kidney disease, HTN, dyslipidemia, and multiple vasculopathies presenting with hyperglycemia


#) Hyperglycemia:
 Elevated glucose, serum osm, lack of anion gap, and absence of urine ketones suggest HHS. Most likely etiology is steroid-induced hyperglycemia superimposed on ? underlying DM (HgbA1c 6.80 in the past).  No e/o infectious-trigger (urine culture negative and CXR equivocal).  Rapidly improving after IVF in ED and insulin.  Current FSBG 330.  Diagnostic evaluation: will send repeat HgbA1c, FSBG before meals, qd electrolytes.  Therapeutic intervention: will hold IVF given new a-fib and signs of volume overload (see below); give 10 U regular insulin now and SSI with meals (convert daily usage to NPH); potassium repletion PRN




#) A-fib:
 New onset a-fib.  Differential includes fluid overload, hyperthyroidism, pre-existing structural heart disease (LAH, mitral regurg/stenosis).  CHADS2 score: 12.5% risk of stroke over the next year if not on anticoagulation.  Currently rate-controlled 80s.  Diagnostic evaluation: echocardiogram, TSH, cardiac monitor.  Therapeutic intervention: d/c amlodipine (given LE edema) and start low dose dilt (30 mg TID) for continued rate control.  On ASA.  Will discuss risks/benefits of coumadin w/ patient and PCP.



#) Troponin leak: In the absence of chest pain/angina or concerning EKG changes, this likely represents heart strain in the context of chronic kidney disease. 
Will trend enzyme, repeat EKG, and monitor for changes in clinical status.




#) Edema
: differential includes congestive heart failure vs worsening kidney disease vs iatrogenic volume overload vs capillary leak syndrome (from steroids, norvasc). 
Given duration, clinical picture, and elevated BNP (although no baseline comparison), concerning for CHF.  Diagnostic evaluation: echocardiogram, TSH, etc. w/ more extensive evaluation as needed.  Therapeutic intervention: will hold lasix given underlying kidney function, continue HCTZ, monitor I/Os.




#) Bullous pemphigoid
: Will restart prednisone taper at 40 mg daily per dermatology outpatient note w/ goal of one additional week, then 20 mg daily for three weeks. 
Will contact dermatology regarding modifications to the regimen, if any.




#) HTN
: Currently well-controlled.  Continue doxazosin 2 mg qHS, HCTZ 12.5 PO daily

Aliskiren/HCTZ 12.5 mg daily, and clonidine 0.2 mg PO BID.  Monitor and add additional agents as needed




#) Chronic kidney disease: Cr slightly above baseline, but improving with hydration.  Will monitor.  No current indications for renal replacement therapy.



#) 
? PNA:  Afebrile and asymptomatic (no cough, chest pain, tachycardia, tachypnea, leukocytosis, or left shift).  Will hold antibiotics.



#) Gout: cont. allopurinol (redosed for renal function)



#) FEN: Diabetic diet



#) PPX: GI: PPI; PCP: bactrim; Bowel: none; Steroids: vit D; DVT: heparin

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. Potts is a 60 year old
male who comes for follow up of hypertension, hyperlipidemia
and other medical problems.
1.  Hypertension.  Continues on medications without chest
pain, shortness of breath, or pedal edema.
2.  Hyperlipidemia. Continues on medication. No myalgias..
3.  Erectile disorder.  He has run out of Viagra, which
continues to work well at 50 mg dose.  Would like more.
4.  Low HDL.  He has not been taking Lopid for the past 2
months because his prescription ran out and has had
difficulty getting in here to have it renewed.
5.  Anxiety.  He has not had any further unpredictable
attacks of anxiety.  He did recently use some lorazepam when
he had to fly, but not at any other times.

6.  Seasonal allergies. Episodic rhinitis and pruritus. Needs more Claritan
MEDICATIONS:  Viagra, lorazepam 0.5 mg t.i.d. p.r.n.,
atenolol 50 mg q.d., Lipitor 20 mg q.d., aspirin q.d.,
diltiazem extended release 180 mg q.d., and Claritin-D
24-Hour 1 p.o. q.d. p.r.n.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  As above and no nausea, vomiting,
dysuria, or leg pain.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient appears well.  Blood
pressure 126/76, weight 224 pounds, heart rate 72 and
regular.  Chest:  Clear to percussion and auscultation. 
Cardiovascular exam:  Notable for 1/6 holosystolic murmur at
the lower left sternal border to the apex.  Abdominal exam:
No masses, tenderness, or organomegaly.  Extremities:  No
edema.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
1.  Hypertension.  Good control, no change in therapy.
2.  Hyperlipidemia.  He did not return for fasting lipid
analysis.  Will continue medication at present level and
again ask him to return for fasting exam.
3.  Erectile disorder.  Viagra refilled.
4.  Low HDL.  I will try Niaspan sustained release 1500 mg
p.o. q.d.  I discussed flushing sensation.  I asked him to
take it at bedtime.  If the flushing sensation gets to be a
problem, I encouraged him to take it in the morning about
half an hour after he takes his aspirin.
5.  Anxiety.  Improved.
6.  Seasonal allergies.  Renewed Claritin prescription.

In addition to above prescriptions, renewed all other
chronic prescriptions as well.

Seen with Dr. Feliciano.  The past medical history, social

history, family history, review of systems, medications, and

allergies were reviewed and confirmed.  Please see resident's

note for further details.  I had interviewed and examined the

patient myself.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Briefly, this is a 75-year-old

female with a known history of CAD, status post MI, EF of 10 to

15% with an AICD placement.  Also, history of CHF and

hyperparathyroidism.  She presents with complaints of shortness

of breath for the past 3 hours with some epigastric discomfort. 

She denies fever, chills, or cough.  She has had some abdominal

and chest discomfort.  She may be from 1 year ago showing no

reversible ischemia but a previous catheterization showing no

disease.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She lives with her family.  She is a former

smoker.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Otherwise, negative.

MEDICATIONS:  She takes albuterol, Lipitor, captopril, digoxin,

Levoxyl, Lasix, and Coumadin.

ALLERGIES:  Has allergies to morphine.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She is afebrile, heart rate111, blood

pressure 105/7118, and oxygen saturation 100% on 4 liters.  She

is awake, alert, and in moderate distress.  HEENT: 

Normocephalic, atraumatic.  Pupils:  Equal, round and reactive to

light.  Sclerae are anicteric.  Neck is supple and nontender. 

Chest is with bibasilar crackles.  Cardiovascular exam: 

Irregularly irregular with a 2/6 systolic murmur at the left

upper sternal border.  Abdomen is soft and nontender.  Skin is

warm and dry.  Extremities without clubbing, cyanosis, or edema. 

Neurological:  Alert and oriented.  Cranial nerves II through XII

are intact.  There are no motor or sensory deficits.

Initial cardiogram showing numerous PVCs with occasional negative

complex is consistent with her previous EKG with the appearance

of likely atrial fibrillation.  After some diuresis and a beta

blockade, she has slowed down to the 90s from the 130s and

appeared to have normal sinus rhythm with frequent PVCs.  Her

chest film shows some mild CHF, and she was started on heparin.

LABORATORY DATA:  Sodium 134, glucose 178.  Normal extending

chemistries.  CK of 115 with an MB of 2.  Digoxin level is 0.8. 

TSH is 8.8.  Troponin is less than assay.  White count is 7.5,

hematocrit 42, and platelets 238,000.  INR 2.1.  Heparin was not

initiated as she was already anticoagulated, but she did receive

diuresis.  She is admitted in stable condition.

CLINICAL IMPRESSION:  Unstable angina with frequent PVCs.  Her

cardiology consultation is pending at this time.

Selected recent labs:

 K 4.4, Creat 4.2. WBC 7.5, Creat 35.8, Plts 401. INR 0.9



Assessment and plan:

   40 y.o. with multiple risk factors for CAD. HTN, high chol, IDDM. Previous LAD stent with restenosis. Then second LAD stent and finally RCA stent. Now with admit for NSTEMI. Transferred for urgent cath. Plan for eventual renal transplant at CVH (had been waiting for Plavix to be completed). Pre-treated with mucomyst. 



Given her previous restenosis, and the fact that further Plavix courses are postponing her renal transplant....she would be best served with CABG if she has restenosis. 



Further plan per Dr Rollins

Follow up with Dr Eaves

CC: L foot pain



HPI:  52 y/o F with Hx of HTN, hyperlipidemia, PVD, s/p R fem-pop bypass and L fem-DP bypass, both in 2066.  She was doing well until April 2078, when she presented with a non-healing ulcer and gangrene in her L third toe and subsequently underwent a redo L fem-anterior tibial bypass using R basilic and cephalic veins on 5/3/78.  On 6/11/78 she had graft scanning, which indicated a widely patent left leg graft and ankle-brachial indices at that time were normal bilaterally.  However, she presented on 9/17/78 c/o L foot pain.  On physical exam, she was noted to have a very small pinhole ulcer over the plantar aspect of her left great toe.  She now presents with increasing pain, &#8220;32&#8221; on scale 0-10 that is constant in nature, with occasional sharp spikes in intensity.  She also confirms loss of sensation and motor strength in the L foot, but there is no paresthesia.  She denies CP, SOB, N/V, flank pain, or any urinary Sx and has no history of cardiac disease.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:

52 y/o F with Hx of diabetes type I and PVD, s/p several bypasses, presenting with worsening L foot pain of two weeks duration.  On physical exam, L foot is exquisitely tender and while it is warm to touch, it is erythematous and there is an ulcer on the plantar surface of the big toe.  In addition, ABIs from today show L ankle ABI of 0.19.  The etiology of her pain is an occlusion of the L fem-anterior tibial bypass vs. diabetic neuropathy, however, she has been taking neurontin without relief and the diabetic neuropathy is less likely.



- oxycodone for pain control, continue neurontin

- continue home atenolol, ASA, Valsartan

- NPO from midnight, pepcid

- check chem7, CBC, coags

- has an insulin pump

- angiography vs. angioplasty tomorrow

Re:  William Potts
     MR#  109-16-75-8
 
Dear Matt:
 
I had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Potts in follow up today.  As you
know, he recently had a complicated hospital course.  He underwent
cardiac catheterization, which revealed serial stenoses of the LAD
including 70% and 90% stenoses.  The first marginal branch had a
60% ostial stenosis.  The right coronary artery had 60 and 80%
stenoses, respectively.  The PDA had a 70% narrowing.  Given his
very significant wish not to have bypass surgery, it was decided to
proceed with angioplasty of the right coronary artery as well as
the obtuse marginal.  It was felt that the LAD was a small vessel,
and not worth going after at this time.  The RCA was successfully
stented, but was complicated by occlusion of the posterior left
ventricular branch.  By the end of the procedure, flow had been
restored to some degree to the posterior left ventricular branch,
but Mr. Potts rule in for a small subendocardial myocardial
infarction.  Due to the closure of the left posterior ventricular
branch, the obtuse marginal branch was not dilated.  
 
Mr. Potts underwent two exercise tests post procedure. The second
exercise test was performed with MIBI imaging.  He exercised for
nine minutes on a submaximal Bruce protocol, and experienced chest
pain.  He had a maximal blood pressure of 148/72 and a heart rate
of 121.  MIBI images revealed a small nontransmural myocardial
infarction of the basal 1/3 of the inferior wall.  There was
moderate to severe ischemia of the inferolateral territory in the
territory of the RCA.
 
Given these findings, it was highly recommended that Mr. Potts
undergo bypass surgery.  
 
Mr. Potts was discharged on aspirin, Ticlid 250 mg b.i.d.,
Atorvastatin 20 mg q.h.s., Atenolol 50 mg b.i.d., Imdur 60 mg q.d. 
He also takes vitamin E and a multivitamin.
 
Of note is that Mr. Potts has been under quite a bit of stress
recently.  His 89-year-old mother has been at Whitehead recovering
William Potts
MR#  109-16-75-8              -2-       January 5, 2070
 
from a hip fracture.  He is having difficulty arranging the
appropriate insurance to cover her medications. 
 
Mr. Potts has been experiencing chest pain since discharge.  This
occurs with increased activity, and is relief with either rest
and/or 1 nitroglycerin.  He has decreased his work level
considerably, and is relatively sedentary.
 
On physical exam, he was well appearing and in no distress.  He had
a blood pressure of 112/70, with a heart rate of 60.  His weight
was 203 pounds.  Chest was clear to auscultation and percussion. 
Cardiac exam revealed a flat JVP of 30 degrees, a nondisplaced PMI
with a normal S1 and S2, without murmurs, rubs, or gallops. 
Carotids are 2+ bilaterally without bruits.   His abdomen is soft,
nontender.  There is no organomegaly, and no hepatojugular reflux. 
Extremities are without edema.
 
Electrocardiogram reveals a normal sinus rhythm with a rate of 61. 
Intervals are .16/.08/.42, with an axis of -10 degrees. There are
flipped T-waves in III and AVF.   I did not have an old
electrocardiogram here for comparison.
 
Therefore, Mr. Potts returns today still experiencing angina with
mild exertion.  He has agreed to undergo coronary artery bypass
surgery.  He has found out that if he is cleared to go back to work
by his physicians, that the Screen Actor's Guild will make a good case for this. 
There has been precedent for those who have had bypass surgery to
return to work as an actor.   Given Mr. Potts's current
feeling, I will make an appointment with Dr. Earl Jacob as soon
as possible for him to be seen prior to scheduling bypass surgery.
 
It is somewhat worrisome that Mr. Potts will be caring for his 89-
year-old mother at home, along with his wife.  His mother currently
uses a walker, and I have warned Mr. Potts that he really cannot
exert himself to any great degree in terms of helping his mother in
the house.  He understands this, and if his chest pain should
become more frequent, intense, or prolonged, he will immediately
call me.  
 
If Mr. Potts is not scheduled for surgery, I will see him in two
weeks at NDNH.  
 
With best regards.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  The patient is a 61 year old gentleman
here for his first visit to me as his PCP, referred by Dr.
Xavier.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS/PAST MEDICAL HISTORY BY PROBLEMS:
 The patient has no acute complaints today.  His medical
history includes:
1.  Hypertension.  He is currently on hydrochlorothiazide 25
mg q.d. and aspirin q.d.
2.  Hypercholesterolemia.  The patient is on 30 mg q.h.s. of
simvastatin.  His last lipid panel in April of this year
showed total cholesterol of 196, triglycerides 169, HDL 52,
and LDL of 110.  He has no LFTs on file.
3.  Psychiatry.  According to the patient, he carried a
diagnosis of major depression with paranoid features.  He is
being followed by Dr. Uhler, psychiatrist at Marshfield Clinic as well as Betty Villasenor, a therapist at Marshfield Clinic.  He is currently on Depakote, Tegretol, Risperdal,
and Paxil although he does not know the doses of his
medications.  He still feels depressed but his paranoid
symptoms have subsided.  He has no manic or hypermanic
episodes.

MEDICATIONS:  Aspirin 325 mg q.d., Paxil, Risperdal,
Tegretol, Depakote doses unknown, simvastatin 30 mg q.h.s.,
HCTZ 20 mg q.d.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  No tobacco, alcohol, or recreational drugs.
 He quit drinking alcohol 16 years ago.  He has not been
sexually active for 16 years and is currently not
interested.  He lives by himself in  Denver Drive, walks
about 20 minutes per day, and is from Louisa originally.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Mother and father died of MIs in their 70s.
 There is no history of sudden cardiac death.  No cancer,
liver, kidney, or thyroid disease in the family.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Blood pressure 132/84, heart rate 84,
and weight 202 pounds.  The remainder of the exam is
deferred.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
1.  Hypertension.  The patient is well controlled on his
current regimen.  I will therefore not change anything
today.
2.  Hypercholesterolemia.  The patient is at his goal LDL
level.  I will continue to follow his lipid panel yearly.  I
will also check LFTs today, given that he had a statin.
3.  Psychiatry.  The patient will follow up with his
psychiatrist and therapist.  He will let me know his actual
medication and medication doses at his earliest convenience.
 Also, I will recheck an LFT as stated above, given that he
is on possibly hepatotoxic psychoactive medications.
4.  Healthcare maintenance.  I have emphasized to the
patient the benefits of weight reduction as well as
increasing his exercise.  He is not interested in any
exercise as in walking and I have therefore counseled him to
walk longer and faster.  He had a negative flexible
sigmoidoscopy in November 2083 and I will give him stool
cards today.  His last tetanus was 10 years ago and he is
not interested in the booster today.  His immunizations are
otherwise up to date according to him and he will need the
remainder of the history and a full physical exam at the
next visit in 3 months' time.

Present Illness:  

Ms. Mckee thinks that she will be discharged today. If so, we must be confident that she is able to draw up and inject insulin reliably. She will also needs prescriptions for metformin, 
insulin syringes (give her 1 cc syringes), NPH and Regular insulins. She apparently has glucose testing material at home. Will start with the following regimen, in addition to metformin 500 mg bid. She will follow up with her PCP, 
Dr. Robert Xenakis.



Before Breakfast:



NPH        30 Units



Regular      8 Units                  Blood Sugar under 101

89 Buck St

Sioux City, FL  76546

 

 

VivianLee Jorgenson

MR# 471-90-84-7

November 24, 2071

 

This is the first visit for Ms. Jorgenson who is a 64 year old woman who presents 

for management of papillary thyroid cancer.  Her symptoms began in May, 2071, 

when she felt a prominence in her neck.  She did not experience any dysphagia 

or voice changes, but presumably was felt to have an abnormality on thyroid 

examination.  She underwent a thyroid biopsy in June, 2071, at a local 

hospital.  The pathology which was read at JMH revealed numerous follicular 

cells with chromatin grooves suspicious for papillary carcinoma.  She was 

subsequently referred to Dr. Geiger at JMH for thyroidectomy and underwent 

thyroidectomy on 9/17/71.  The thyroidectomy was uncomplicated though there 

was inadvertent displacement of a parathyroid gland and this gland was then 

reimplanted.  According to the operative report, the carcinoma was felt to be 

locally extensive though no laryngo-tracheal nerve invasion was present.  The 

pathology revealed a (R) 6 cm papillary carcinoma with capsular and 

lymphovascular invasion.  There was an additional focus of papillary 

carcinoma, follicular variant, in the (L) thyroid lobe that was 0.3 cm.   Of 

note, the tissue was stained for calcitonin and this was negative.  The tumor 

did stain positively for thyroglobulin.  

 

Since undergoing thyroidectomy, Ms. Jorgenson has done fairly well.  She has been 

maintained on 75 mcg daily of Levoxyl.  She says that she feels generally 

well on this dose though she does endorse slight fatigue.  She denies any 

changes in her sleep, hair, skin or bowels.  She does endorse a one pound 

weight gain over the last two months.  She denies any paresthesias or other 

symptoms consistent with hypocalcemia.  She denies any history of thyroid 

disturbances prior to her diagnosis of cancer.  She is now referred for 

consideration of radioiodine ablation.  

 

Past Medical History:Notable for congestive heart failure.  She has an 

ejection fraction of 25%.  She also has a history of hypercholesterolemia, 

hypertension, and anxiety.  No history of childhood irradiation.  

 

Current Medications:Digoxin 0.25 daily; Coreg 12.5 mg daily; Levoxyl 75 

mcg daily; Lipitor 10 mg daily; Coumadin 5 mg daily; Lasix 40 mg daily; 

captopril 50 mg, tid; labetolol 100, bid; nitroglycerine.

 

Allergies:No known drug allergies.

 

Social History:Remote history of tobacco.  She quit 4 years ago.  She 

endorses rare alcohol use.  She is married with four children.  

 

Family History:Negative for thyroid cancer.  

 

Physical Exam:Blood pressure is elevated at 188/92.  Weight 208.  Pulse 

88.  In general this is a somewhat tired, slightly pale-appearing woman in 

NAD.  HEENT:  PERRLA.  EOMI.  No proptosis or lid lag.  Neck: supple with a 

large well-healed thyroidectomy scar.  No

remaining thyroid tissue or lymphadenopathy is appreciated.  Lungs: clear to 

auscultation bilaterally.  Cardiovascular: normal S1, S2, regular rate and 

rhythm.  Abdomen: soft, slightly distended, non-tender, moderately obese.  

Extremities: trace pedal edema, 1+ distal pulses.  Neurologic: reflexes are 

slightly delayed.  There is no tremor of outstretched hands.  

 

Review of Labs:Of note, include a TSH of 1.65 from August, 2071, that was 

prior to surgery.  Free T4 at that time was normal at 1.1.  Calcium prior to 

surgery was slightly elevated at 10.6 though several calciums drawn after her 

surgery were in the mid-8 range. 

 

Impression:This is a 64 year old woman with a history of congestive heart 

failure who is now s/p total thyroidectomy for papillary thyroid cancer.  Ms. 

Jorgenson is potentially at higher risk for recurrence given the fact that she is 

older at the time of diagnosis, she had a large-size tumor, and she had 

multifocal disease. 

 

Plan:Check a TSH and thyroglobulin today for a baseline.  We suspect that 

she may be undertreated on her current dose of Levoxyl.  I have recommended 

131I treatment.  Benefits and risks were discussed.  In addition, I think she 

would tolerate thyroid hormone withdrawal.  TSH and calcium were drawn today. 

 

We will plan to arrange  for 131I for January.

HPI:  Mr. Orta is a 50-year-old African-American man who has been 
treated for the five past years by LBH at Edgefield.  He was seen in MHC 
clinic prior to that.  His LBH physician was Dr. Jaeger and his phone 
number is 872-9985.  Patient was last seen one year ago due to the fact 
that he lost his job and his insurance with LBH and states that he has 
not seen a physician in the past year.
 
His medical problems include:
1.   Coronary artery disease with angioplasty in 2063.  It is unclear 
     which vessels were plastied.  
2.   Hypercholesterolemia treated in the past with gemfibrozil and niacin 
     for coexistent hypertriglyceridemia.  However, he has not taken any 
     niacin or gemfibrozil for the past year as well. 
3.   Anxiety.
4.   Condyloma last fall.
 
Medications:  1) enteric coated aspirin 325mg q.d.; 2) lorazepam 1mg PO 
q.h.s. prescribed by Dr. Guadalupe Thacker at LBH.  Patient also had 
nitroglycerin tablets at home.  Patient used to use diltiazem 30mg PO 
t.i.d.; however, that was stopped a year ago when he lost his insurance.  
He does not have any history of hypertension in the past.
 
Social history:  He is currently not working.  He has been unemployed for 
a month and a half.  He used to be a social worker which did not 
involve any heavy lifting.  He did community services managment.  He 
lives with his mother and his sister and has never been married.  
 
Review of systems:  Patient states that he has very infrequent episodes of 
chest pains over the last 10 years.  However, he does say that his last 
chest pain was approximately a week and a half ago.  When asked where the 
pain was he put his hand over this mid-epigastrium and stated that the 
pain was very similar to the pain he used to have prior to his 
angioplasty.  He took two sublingual nitroglycerins and the pain was 
relieved within a few minutes of the second nitroglycerin tablet.  At the 
time he was just sitting on his couch watching television.  He has no 
history of exertional angina over the last several years.  However, this 
complaint of chest pain at rest is very worrisome for unstable angina.  He 
currently does not complain of any shortness of breath, dyspnea on 
exertion, palpitation, or pre-syncope.
 
On physical examination Mr. Orta is a middle-aged black male in no 
apparent distress.  Temperature was afebrile.  Heart rate was 68 and 
regular.  Blood pressure was 126/92 in the right arm in a sitting 
position.  HEENT was within normal limits.  Lungs were clear bilaterally.  
Heart exam was regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  
Abdomen was benign.  Extremities were without edema or lesions.

     his past history of angioplasty and his recent complaint of chest 
     pain at rest is worrisome for unstable angina.  Given that he is on 
     no current cardiac medication except for aspirin, I will decide to 
     initiate therapy with diltiazem CD 120mg PO q.d. in an attempt to 
     control his blood pressure and heart rate.  I also encouraged him to 
     continue his aspirin daily and gave him a fresh bottle of 
     nitroglycerin tablets for use with any chest pain in the near future.  
     The plan will be to get the patient on stable dose of diltiazem and 
     maximize the dose for his heart and blood pressure control.  After he 
     has been on a stable dose for several days, we will perform an 
     outpatient stress test to evaluate whether the patient has any 
     evidence of ischemia at this time.  If he does, we will recommend a 
     cardiac catheterization to treat any potential lesions which may be 
     causing syms of rest angina.  The case was discussed with any 
     cardiacs that are on call.
 
2.   Given the patient's history of coronary artery disease I sent an 
     SMA-20 level off to assess for hypercholesterolemia which he does 
     have with a cholesterol of 291 and hypertriglyceridemia which he also 
     has at a level of 336.  He has been taking gemfibrozil and niacin in 
     the past; however, he has not been taking it for the last year.  I 
     instructed him to decrease the amount of cholesterol and fats in his 
     diet and explained which food contain those products.  I will also 
     initiate treatment with a HMG CoA inhibitor which should decrease 
     both his cholesterol as well as the triglycerides.  We will start him 
     off on simvastatin 20mg PO q.d. later this week.
 
3.   Daily anxiety.  Will continue the patient's Ativan in an attempt to 
     control his daily anxiety which he says is well controlled without 
     Ativan.
 
4.   History of condyloma in his genital area from last year.  Patient 
     states that he currently has several lesions which we will examine on 
     his next visit.  If he does, we will refer him to dermatology for 
     liquid nitrogen treatment to remove the lesions.

Infectious Disease Consultation





Patient Name: Moss, Derek

MR: 89659991

Reason for consult: assistance with management of possible persistent L shoulder septic arthritis in patient pre-op for planned hip replacement 

Source: patient, MR

Counsult requested by: Dr. Everett Pace

Date of consult: 1/20

Location: 4E-66

__________________________________________________________________



HPI: Mr. Moss is a 77 yo M with PmHx significant for DMII, CHF (EF 20-25%), afib, Parkinson's, prostate cancer s/p XRT c/b proctitis and GIB, multiple hip replacements, s/p multiple knee surgeries who, recently treated for S. aureus L shoulder septic arthritis (10/87) who presented 1/19 s/p fall.  



Mr. Moss has experienced multiple falls recently, and was ultimately diagnosed with Parkinsons last September.  Following the diagnosis, he was discharged to Bellaire City Hospital, where he continued to experience falls.  After one episode, he was forcibly picked up, and began to have L shoulder pain thereafter.  He also noted a cut over the L elbow on transfer to the NH that was slow to heal.   After several weeks of worsening shoulder pain, erythema, and warmth, he was re-hospitalized at Ouagadougou, where he underwent L shoulder aspiration.  MRI 10/87 demonstrated complete rupture of the rotator cuff, with associated large joint effusion.  Of note, he denied fevers, chills, or NS.

L shoulder aspiration 10/10/87 demonstrated purulent fluid, with 2,800,000 WBC (97%PMN). Gram stain demonstrated GPC in clusters.  He subsequently underwent L shoulder I&D 10/12, with removal of 300cc of frankly purulent fluid.  He was started on cefazolin.  Culture results returned a pan-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus isolate (including to ampicillin, cefazolin, clindamycin, penicillin, rifampin).  Blood cultures were negative.  He was taken back to the OR 10/16 for arthroscopy, with extensive debridement.  Interop findings included demonstration of significant fibrinous tissue, with no normal-appearing cartiledge present.  A penrose was placed into a large cavity down the subdeltoid rescess, and a second in the subacromial space.  He was transitioned to ampicillin 2g q6 hours x 2 weeks, and then given amoxicillin (either 1g BID or 500mg TID, unsure which) x 2 weeks.  



Repeat R shoulder MRI obtained 12/12/87, which was reviewed with staff radiologist, and demonstrated again complete tear of the supra/infraspinatus/teres minor/ subscapularis/ biceps tendons, with also persistent large joint effusion, extensive synovitis, and full thickness cartiledge loss of glenoid and humeral head.  Also noted was possible AVN of medial portion of the humeral head. Overall, was difficult to tell from MRI whether findings represented prior vs active disease.  



Mr. Moss was seen in the ID clinic 1/18, at which time he complained of a several week h/o progressively worsening L shoulder discomfort with activity.  He did not experience shoulder pain at rest, and had not recently noted erythema.  No drainage.  Appetite was near baseline, though he had experienced fatigue.  Blood glucoses had been well controlled.  His daughter in law brought in extensive data on his home vital signs, which revealed absence of fever except for a single isolated temp of 103, with stable pulse/BP, and overall well controlled blood sugars.    



Date 		ESR	CRP

12/6/87	88 	23

Unfortunately,  Mr. Moss sustained a mechanical fall 1/19.  Following the fall, he had significantly increased hip pain.  Hip/pelvis films notable for femoral component with lucency measuring more than 2mm superolaterally and along the stem. Orthopedic team felt that loosening of hardware would require another hip revision.

Micro Data: 

None recently



Shoulder aspirate as per HPI (S aureus, pan sensitive)



Imaging:

Pelvis/Hip (right) films:  Bilateral total hip arthroplasties without any acute fracture or dislocation.  The acetabular component demonstrates vertical inclination with evidence of polyethylene wear. The femoral component demonstrates lucency measuring more than 2mm superolaterally and along the stem consistent with granulomatous disease. There is no subsidence or loosening based on Grauer's classification.



AP chest film: no acute pulmonary process, probable cardiomegaly.



Assessment: 77 yo M with DMII, CHF (EF 20-25%), afib, Parkinson's, prostate cancer s/p XRT c/b proctitis and GIB, multiple hip replacements, recently treated for S. aureus L shoulder septic arthritis (10/87 - 11/87) who presented 1/19 s/p fall.  With regards to his shoulder, it is difficult to know whether his infection was cured by the 4-week abx course.  Though his shoulder does not appear to be grossly infected on exam, 2 months after completion of his course, it is too early to determine sterilization of the shoulder on a clinical basis.  The MRI is difficult to interpret, and may well reflect prior inflammatory changes.  He did have persistently elevated inflammatory markers (though confounded by multiple comorbidities).  Given the possibility that he had cleared the infection, our plan as of the clinic visit Wednesday had been to observe him clinically, off abx, for signs of recurrent infection.  However, given his fall and the possibility of new hardware placement, would now favor a more aggressive workup of his shoulder.  As such, would recommend shoulder aspiration off antibiotics.  



The source for the L shoulder staph infection was never elucidated, and blood cultures were negative.  However, such septic arthritis often results from hematogenous seeding, and there is a small change that his R hip may also have become infected.  This could help to explain the prosthesis loosening.  Alternatively, he may have had hardware mechanical failure in setting of falls, or less likely involvement by his prostatic ca (?read of granulomatous disease around the prosthesis).  



Recommendations:

-hold antibiotics, including pre-operative prophylactic antibiotics to allow optimal culture data

-Aspirate shoulder.  Send fluid for cell counts, Gram stain, aerobic/anaerobic/fungal cultures

-if do not see contraindication to proceeding with planned hip replacement

-would obtain hip biopsies in the OR, again off abx, to assess for possible hip infection

-likewise, would send OR hip specimen to pathology to assess for infection vs. neoplastic involvement

-check CK, given elevated Cr following fall, and possible rhabdo



Thank you for this interesting consultation.  We will continue to follow with you.

YARBROUGH,IRENE   810-86-43-7                        VISIT DATE: 03/10/79
HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  This patient was seen with Dr. 
Nettles, Emergency Medicine resident.  The Chief Complaint, History 
of Present Illness, Past Medical History, Medications, Allergies, 
Social History, Family History and Review of Systems are as noted 
by Dr. Nettles on the record and were reviewed with him and with 
the patient.  Briefly, this is a 55 year old woman who presented 
with chest pain which was epigastric and substernal in nature, 
essentially sharp and non-radiating that had come on at rest.  She 
has several cardiac risk factors including hypertension, obesity 
and hormone replacement but had no specific cardiac history.  Her 
symptoms did not resolve with Mylanta. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  As noted by Dr. Nettles and is most 
noteworthy for normal heart sounds, although she does have a II/VI 
systolic ejection murmur at the apex (the upper right sternal 
border). 
LABORATORY EVALUATION:  An electrocardiogram does not show acute 
changes but does have T wave inversions in V1 to V3.  These were 
previously noted in 10/78. 
THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  The patient required nitroglycerine 
and nitroglycerine, IV nitroglycerine and IV heparin with some 
morphine to relieve her pain.  She also received Lopressor 25 mg IV 
and was given some GI meds.  She eventually became pain-free, 
although she does admit to a residual mild discomfort in her chest. 
There are no electrocardiographic changes. 
IMPRESSION:  I concur with Dr. Nettles that this patient has chest 
pain suspicious for unstable angina.  She has responded well to 
aggressive treatment of this and she will be admitted for further 
evaluation. 
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  Chest pain. 
DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  Admission. 
Condition satisfactory.

The patient was seen by me in the emergency department with Dr. 
Whittaker.  The resident's note was reviewed and the patient was 
interviewed and examined by me. 
HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  The patient is a very pleasant, 
50 year-old gentleman who presents with gross hematemesis and 
coffee-ground emesis.  He had it during the night and then this 
morning developed coffee-grounds turned to red blood emesis.  He 
denies any light-headedness, chest pain or abdominal pain.  He has 
had some diarrhea over the last seven months, of unclear etiology. 
No melena. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Chronic renal failure, myocardial 
infarction, insulin dependent diabetes. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  GENERAL:  The patient was hemodynamically 
stable, well-appearing, nontoxic.  LUNGS:  Clear.  HEART:  Regular 
rate and rhythm.  ABDOMEN:  Soft with tenderness to palpation in 
the bilateral lower quadrants.  NG tube lavage showed 200 cc of 
pink tinged fluid, cleared after 50 cc. 
LABORATORY EVALUATION:  Hematocrit was 46, white count 11, 
potassium 6.6, moderately hemolyzed.  BUN was 62, creatinine 6.9. 
THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  The patient will be seen by the 
renal service and admitted to the medical service.  The patient 
will need dialysis and endoscopy tomorrow.  See resident's note for 
details. 
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  Upper GI bleed. 
DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  The patient was 
admitted in satisfactory condition.

      Team A Intern Admit Note

Patient Name: Tammy Umphrey

MR#  0942207

Date of Admission:  8/26/66

Attending: Yoel Pollard

PCP:  Susan Ullom



CC/ID:  70 yo woman with significant disability following cerebral aneurysm rupture 1/ 66, admitted with likely UTI and question of altered mental status



HPI:  (As summarized from ED admit note and computer notes, pt is not able to give history and family is not present.)  Ms. Umphrey is somewhat cognitively and expressively impaired following rupture of a cerebral aneurysm 1/ 66; she was required sub-occipital craniotomy, clot evacuation, and placement for a VP shunt.  She was transferred to Kingsley County Clinic 2/66, and was d/c'd 5/31/66. Discharge summary indicates that her baseline at that time included being able to follow 1 step commands part of the time and some attempts at communication.  She gets nutrition and medication through a G-tube at this point, and has had an indwelling foley catheter.

	Computer notes suggest that prior to August 5, the indwelling foley catheter had been removed. However, the patient's constant incontinence and difficulty keeping a decubitus ulcer dry, the notes suggest that the foley was replaced 8/5/66.  8/09/66 Ms. Umphrey was taken to the emergency room; the symptoms she was having at that time are not clear. U/A was suggestive of a UTI, and she was treated with a 3-day course of levofloxacin. There is no record of her foley catheter being changed at that time, and urine cultures were not sent.  Telephone notes from 8/23 suggest that Ms. Umphrey had yeast infection and foley blockage;  8/25 the VNA checked a U/A at home; results were consistent with a UTI.  Her husband reports that she has also been more somnolent and    less herself    over the last few days. She was sent to the PDI ED for further evaluation.

	In the ED, repeat U/A was consistent with UTI; urine culture grew abundant staph aureus. She was given a dose of levofloxacin 500mg and transferred to the floor.

Microbiology:





CXR:	The findings are consistent with pulmonary venous hypertension with possible early interstitial edema.



Head CT:  1. No significant change compared to prior CT Brain-04/18/2066.

	No change in ventricle size.   No acute infarct; although, this is

	better assessed with MR with diffusion.

	2.  Patchy low attenuation areas in the centrum semiovale

	bilaterally which are more prominent now and most likely are due

	to chronic microangiopathic changes in this agroup.



EKG:	Normal sinus rhythm, normal axis, normal intervals. Flattened T-waves, but not changed from prior exam. No evidence of acute ischemia.



Impression:  70 yo woman with compromised baseline neurologic function, admitted with complicated UTI and possible change in mental status.



Mental status changes: given likely undertreated UTI 8/09/66, pt likely has recurrent complicated UTI and may have some mental status alterations from this source. Important to rule out VP-shunt complication as cause of mental status chage, but CT appears unchanged from 4/66. Hyponatremia may also be contributing somewhat  to mental status changes.

-will treat UTI and pursue possibility of urosepsis with blood cultures

-will check TSH and am cortisol which could also contribute to mental status changes, particularly given pts history of hypothyroidism

UTI

-likely UTI- tx

-will send blood cultures to assess for sepsis from urinary source

-unclear if staph aureus is true urinary pathogen, but will treat with vancomycin until sensitivities come back, then treat with appropriate antibiotic

-treat with levoquin for complicated UTI while awaiting final microbiology data

-change foley now

-resend u/a and culture after 1-2 days of antibiotics

Hyponatremia- may be contributing to any change in mental status

-volume status very difficult to assess- if hypovolemic, likely hypovolemic hyponatremia. If euvolemic, likely SIADH, which could be caused by neurologic process, pain, or infection

-given difficulty assessing volume status, will send urine for sodium and osm. If low sodium high osm, likely hypovolemic. If higher sodium, more likely SIADH.

DM

-will switch patient to ISS for now to assess in-hospital insulin requirements

Hypothyroidism- continue levothyroxine at home dose, checking TSH

GI/FEN- ranitidine BID, glucerna tube feeds per KCC discharge summary

HTN-continue home medications

wound care consult requested for report of decubitus ulcer

Reason for Visit	

Mr. Whitehead is here for follow-up of multiple issues.



Problems	  

LOW BACK PAIN	      

he had prolonged discogenic back pain in 1/2070 and could not get appt with NAMG orthopedic/back surgeon and went to Montreal Medical Center.  He underwent L4/5 lamenictomy in 2/2070.  He has persistent right-lower back pain and has seen Dr. Conley.  A myleogram done on 8/5/71 showed degenerative disc disease with moderate spinal stenosis at L4/5.  He will be seeing Dr. Sheehan.  Mr. Whitehead is contemplating surgery as he cannot walk without pain.

Elevated blood sugar	      

BS was 191 in 11/1/69 and was in similar range during his hospitalization in Montreal Medical.  He has been on meds for NIDDM.  He could not tolerate high dose of glucophage and is now seeing endocrine.  His HBA1c was 7.5 in 6/71 on glyburide 5 mg bid and glucophage 500 mg qd.  He has regular optho exam and is on zestoretic.  Little rationale to check for microalbuminuria as he is already on ace-inh.  His lipids are controlled with diet and lipitor.

To see endocrine in 9/71.



hyperlipidemia	      

now on lipitor 40 mg qhs.  He has NIDDM and HTN.  His lipid profile from 4/71 showed a LDL of 103.  LFT were normal.  COntinue med.

HYPERTENSION	      

Now on zestoretic 20/25 qd + atenolol 50 mg qd.  He has significant white coat component.  It is again high at 170/80 in left arm.  His BP reading in hospital for myelogram this week was 130/80.  No change.



h/o PROSTATITIS	      

had recurring prostatitis sx's and saw Dr. Dotson.  Cystoscopy in 1/2070 was normal.  He is on flomax 0.4 mg qd and doing better.  His PSA was 2.9 in 8/69 and 3.2 in 8/70.  To see Dr. Dotson soon.



Neurological symptoms	      

he reports having intolerance to bright lights, tingling in his mid anterior abdomen and chest as well as numbness in his left middle three digits with some neck discomfort.  His MRI of his LS spine done at Montreal Medical in early 2070 evidently showed (by his report) no cord abnormalities.  His sx's sound like left-sided cervical radiculopathy but his visual and abdominal sx's makes me concerned about  systemic demyelinating conditions.  Will check TSH, B12 and have him see Dr. Conley. [08/28/70]



TSH and B12 levels were normal.  His sx's in his eyes and abdomen have essentially resolved.  He still has some cervical radiculopathy syptoms.  He will see Dr. Conley (yet to do so). [01/21/71]



still did not see Dr. Conley.  He now has right neck pain.  His left sided numbness has resolved.  Again referred him to Dr. Conley.  He likely has cervical radiculopathy. [04/09/71]



c-spine MRI ordered by Dr. Conley showed mutliple levels of spondylothis.

EKG tachycardia, at least two atrial foci. RBBB.
CXR L lower lung opacity. Poor film.

Impression/Plan: 
87yoM h/o COPD, vascular disease p/w SOB, cough.  Likely COPD flare.  High WBC may be steroids, but CXR too poor to rule out PNA.  Otherwise, no clear precipitant.  Failed steroids as outpatient (dosing unclear).  Given level of dyspnea, will treat w/ solumedrol for now, and transition to prednisone when improvement/trajectory is clear.  Patient may need a longer taper than over 10d.

SOB: COPD flare +/- PNA.
	-repeat CXR in AM.
-solumedrol 125mg q6 for now.  Transition to prednisone 1mg/kg when clinically stable.  Follow trend, decide on length of taper at later date.
-advair, spiriva.  Standing albuterol nebs q4 for now.  Space nebs when improvement demonstrated.
-keep O2 sats 88-92%
CHEST PRESSURE: follow for now.  Would deserve stress.  Unless  has more activity/symptoms while here, would defer to be done as outpatient.  Does have significant risk factors.
	-ROMI by markers.
	-telemetry.
	-ASA, ARB, statin.
	-start low dose beta-blocker to see if he tolerates.
HTN: likely exacerbated by steroids.  Will be moving target in setting of changing steroid dose.
	-c/w home ARB.
	-start lopressor 25 tid for now.
	-hydralazine 25mg q6h for immediate decrease in BP now.  Taper off when able.
DM2: no meds from home
	-RISS, FS qid.
	-check A1c.
FEN: no added salt, low cholesterol/fat, no conc sweets
PROPHY: fragmin, zantac.
CODE: full code (confirmed w/ patient)
DISPO: PT eval.

 Impression: 65 year old gentleman with multiple stroke risk factors, onset of dysarthria, aphasia, dizziness, ataxia at 13:00 today. Symptoms improving over first 30-60 minutes, but residual RUE drift, dysarthria, and (initally) upgoing R toe. Suspicious for L MCA cortical event. L ICA stenosis and/or embolic event +/- fetal left PCA possible concerns (?cortical vs v-b etiology of dizziness). Cannot obtain CTA secondary to elevated creatinine.  



Plan:  

1.	Admit to RDA 

2.	MRI/MRA. MR Perfusion study if L ICA stenosis or suggestion of intracranial stenosis. 

3.	As event occurred on ASA, provide heparin PTT 60-80, continue ASA at decreased dose (81 qD). Watch platelets, as pt starting with platelets =  150

4.	Hold antihypertensive, but continue isosorbide for known cardiac ischemic history. 

5.	Echo, Holter (for known bradycardia; eval for events with HR <<40. 

6.	PT/speech therapy. 

7.	Careful glycemic control (holding metformin).

The patient was seen with Dr. Mueller.  I confirmed her history and

physical.  I also interviewed and examined the patient.  Please

see her note for more details.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 77-year-old female with a

several-week history of nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, which

has worsened over the past 3 days, per the patient and her son. 

These episodes are ""gassy feeling"" in the epigastrium associated

with nausea and vomiting and lightheadedness.  No chest pain, no

shortness of breath.  Of note, the patient has a history of

coronary artery disease with atypical symptoms.  She has also had

a history of pancreatitis.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She is awake and alert, in no distress at

this time.  Afebrile with a pulse of 62, blood pressure 140/60,

and O2 sat 100% on room air.  Neck is supple with no signs of

meningismus.  Head is atraumatic.  Moist mucous membranes.  Lungs

are clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Heart has regular rate

and rhythm.  Abdomen is soft with mild epigastric tenderness to

palpation.  No guarding or rebound on my exam.  Extremities are

warm and well perfused.

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  The patient's IV access was

established.  Labs were drawn revealing white count of 8,

hematocrit of 39.  BUN and creatinine of 36 and 1.5, which is

normal for the patient.  LFTs are normal.  Lipase is slightly

elevated at 67.  Troponin less than assay.  Urinalysis 25-30

white cells.  The patient's EKG was left bundle-branch block,

which is unchanged.  KUB shows no air fluid levels.  This patient

has a possible mild pancreatitis as well as a mild urinary tract

infection.  In addition, she has multiple cardiac risk factors

and an EKG, which will not allow for conventional cardiac stress

testing.

She will be admitted the hospital for enzymatic rule out MI with

a possible necessity to have a stress MIBI as well as to give IV

antibiotics for urinary tract infection and hydration and serial

exams for her probable pancreatitis.  The patient was admitted to

the floor in stable condition.

(687) 396-2722                                12-15-72


CHIEF COMPLAINT: Ms. Xia is a 53 year old woman who comes in in 
follow up. She notes that she is still having occasional sweats at 
night. She is using the clonidine but she can't take it two times a day, 
it makes her too sleepy, so she takes it about 3:30 towards the end of 
her workday and then again before she goes to bed. She is having some 
right lower back pain and otherwise is feeling well.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Negative except as noted. She is also taking the 
Cozaar which she had been taking before. 

She was called back in today as a result of labs which were done 
recently which showed hemoglobin A1C of 8.7, an elevated urine 
microalbuminuria and hypertension which needed follow up.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On exam today, she is well developed and well 
nourished in no acute distress. Blood pressure 158/116, pulse 80, weight 
166. Pupils are equal and equally reactive to light. Lids and 
conjunctiva normal. Retinal fields normal. Disks sharp. Mouth and 
pharynx without erythema or exudate. No adenopathy or tenderness in the 
submandibular, cervical, posterior cervical, supraclavicular areas. 
Heart sounds: S1, S2, with a II/VI systolic murmur heard best at the 
right sternal border. No rub or gallop. Her chest was clear to 
auscultation anteriorly and posteriorly with no rales, wheezes or 
rhonchi. She was clear to percussion. She has normal bowel sounds. Her 
abdomen was soft and nontender, no mass, organomegaly, and no guarding, 
no rebound. Her extremities are without edema, cyanosis or clubbing. She 
has no spine or flank tenderness. Her neck is supple, no bruits. Her 
skin is essentially quite dry and itchy. She has multiple dark, 
hyperpigmented, post-inflammatory scarring on her lower extremities. Her 
mouth and pharynx are without erythema or exudate. 

IMPRESSION/PLAN:
1. Hypertension. Her blood pressure is really not well controlled. I 
will add atenolol to her regimen 50mg PO q.d. She drinks one cup of 
coffee a day and rarely has alcohol although she notes that she will 
occasionally have one, a scotch, on Friday or Saturday. She does not do 
drugs. She will return in three week for follow up of her blood 
pressure and at that time for a physical exam for which she will be due. 

2. Diabetes. The patient had been told in the past that she had diabetes 
but she was told she did not need any sort of treatment for it. Her 
creatinine was 0.8 last month and I explained to her that with her 
elevated hemoglobin at 8.7 she needs treatment. We will start her on 
Glucophage 500mg PO b.i.d. I expect we will need to increase this and if 
she tolerates this she should increase it to 1000mg over the next week. 
I also explained to her that if she does not eat or she is unable to eat 
or if she is NPO she needs to stop taking this medication. I suggested 
she actually take it with food to insure that she only takes when she is 
eating. I gave her a referral to Ophthalmology and to Podiatry. She also 
requested a glucometer machine and this was ordered for her along with

coronary disease with cardiac catheterization and three-vessel 

disease in 2062, and a positive exercise tolerance test in 2063. 

She was with relatively stable symptoms until early this morning 

when she had increase in chest tightness and dyspnea on exertion. 

She has actually been stuttering on and off for 18-24 hours, and 

she came to the emergency department in the earl morning hours for 

evaluation of this problem.  She is presently pain free after 

having received nitrates in the emergency department.

Internal Medicine Intern Admission Note

Name: Tyler Pearson
MR#: 7271902
Date of admission: 14 June 2132
Admitting Intern: Noah Rosario
Admitting Junior: Raymond Pack
Attending: Frank Ash

Chief Complaint: shortness of breath

History of Present Illness: Mr. Pearson is a an 87 year old gentleman with COPD on home oxygen, CVA, DM, and history of lung cancer s/p resection without chemotherapy who presented to the ED with acute shortness of breath.  Of note, he was hospitalized from May 26 until May 29 for a COPD flare, and was discharged home at that time on a prednisone taper, which he completed about one week ago.  He was in his usual state of good health and had even spent the past weekend with family in Connecticut camping.  But on the evening of June 13 he began to feel short of breath, without cough or chest pain, and the dyspnea was made worse with exertion.  Not made worse with lying down.  He also had a fever to 103, without mental status changes.  EMS was called and in the field he was noted to be breathing at a rate in the 40s; he was given a dose of IV lasix and he put out 600cc of urine.  He was then brought to the WMC ED where he continued to display labored breathing, breathing in the 40s, afebrile, tachycardic to 147bpm.  An ABG on BIPAP showed 7.35/53/100.  His blood pressure dropped from systolic 130s to 70/50, and so he was subsequently intubated, and a central and arterial lines placed.  He was given approximately 2L of NS with resultant CVP of 11.  He was also started on dopamine, which was eventually transitioned to norepinephrine.  He was given vancomycin, levaquin, and flagyl, as well as a dose of solumedrol.  He was then transferred to the Internal Medicine.

Review of Systems: per HPI; no changes in mental status; no cough, chest pain, palpitations; no N/V/C/D; no BRBPR or melena; no sick contacts.

Assessment and Plan

Mr. Pearson is a pleasant 87 year old gentleman with a history of COPD, never intubated, who presented with one day of dyspnea.  He had a fever to 103, and presented with hypotension and respiratory distress requiring intubation.  He has an elevated wbc and an increased creatinine to 1.6; his chest x-ray is consistent with a RUL and RML pneumonia, and he has a low bnp negative for cardiac stretching.  His presentation is consistent with sepsis secondary to pneumonia.

Sepsis: continue EGDT, with goal MAP>65 and goal CVP of 8-12
a. IVF with NS for goal CVP 8-12
b. pressors as needed (vasopressin +/- levophed) for goal MAP>65 (currently off pressors)
c. monitor urine output
d. measure central venous oxygen saturation
e. antibiotics for pneumonia: would treat with vancomycin and cefepime, check vancomycin trough tomorrow am
f.  f/u all culture data
g. continue advair 250/50
h. no need for steroids currently, and will not check cort-stim in setting of having received solumedrol in ED
i.  hold antihypertensives (losartan 100mg qd and toprol 100mg qd) in setting of hypotension

ARF: creatinine up to 1.6 from baseline of 1.1, likely pre-renal etiology in setting of sepsis; will give trial hydration

Ppx: ranitidine and heparin

CXR: Clear.



CT Head: No evidence of acute intracranial process.



TTE (2090): Mild-mod MR, EF 61%, no wall motion abnormality.



A/P:  82 yo man w/ PMH significant for well-controlled DM, HTN, and lung ca s/p lobectomy, who presents with one episode of syncope.   



1. Syncope: Most likely etiology of his syncopal episode is vasovagal/ neurocardiogenic, considering the presence of prodromal symptoms (sweating, feeling warm) 5 minutes before the event.  It is possible that the patient has been dehydrated, considering the last couple days have been very humid, and he hasn't changed his fluid intake.  However, the sudden onset of his syncope and LOC for 1-2 minutes concerning for cardiogenic causes as well: including sinus brady and other arrhythmic events.  Ischemic event is less likely in this man.  EKG showed no significant changes compared to the previous one, and he has known MR evidenced on his TTE in 2090.

Other possible causes include:

  	Neurologic: unlikely with no focal neuro symptoms both witnessed at the time and currently.  However, the possibilities include basilar insufficiency.

  	Others: Finger stick glucose on the field 130, and Hct 36.8 (baseline) ruling out hypoglycemia and anemia as an etiology.  

Plan:

1)	Continue hydration overnight. 

2)     Tele monitor to detect any abnormal heart rhythm.

3)     Continue to rule out with enzymes to rule out ischemia.

4)     TTE to assess any focal site for arrhythmogenic events.

5)     TCD and carotid duplex ultrasound to rule out basilar insufficieny, although he displays no signs of it on physical exam.



2. DM: Pt diagnosed with type 2 DM approximately 12 years ago.  Seems to be in a good control, with only diet and exercise modification.  Per pt, the last HgbA1c was in 5-6 range.  

1)	Diabetic diet, RSSI.

2)     Q6h finger stick check.

3)     Check HgbA1c in AM.



3. L ankle swelling: Most likely from sprain while falling down during the syncope.  Tender to palpation and with joint movement.  No signs of infection.  Good peripheral pulses and intact sensations.

1)	L ankle plain films to rule out fracture.

2)     PT consult.



4. FEN: Electrolytes all within normal range, except slightly low Mg (1.5).  Eating PO.  On IVF for hydration.

1)	Replete Mg.  

2)     K now 3.6.  If low in AM, replete for the goal of 4.

3)     Diabetic diet for nutrition.



5. Prophylaxis: Ranitidine, heparin. 



8. Dispo: PT consult.  Anticipate home discharge.

RE:  Branche, Earnest
MRN: 53023691
 
Dear Dr. Xayarath:
 
Your patient Mr. Earnest
Branche returned to the
office today for a follow
up visit.  As you know,
Mr. Branche underwent a
left femoral to posterior
tibial bypass one month
ago followed by
amputation of a
gangrenous first toe.
After being discharged
from our service he was
readmitted to the Medical
Service with a severe
case of C. difficile
colitis.  Ultimately this
resolved and he was
discharged.  Today he
reports that the diarrhea
has again resumed and he
was placed back on an
oral antibiotic
yesterday.  He complains
of only mild incisional
discomfort in his left
leg.
 
On examination, there is
a strong pulse easily
palpated over the left
lower extremity bypass
graft.  The old right
lower extremity bypass
graft was also palpable.
The left foot itself is
warm.  The great toe
incision site, however,
has developed necrotic
tissue all along the
incision, which was
sharply debrided to clean
margins.  This will now
need to be treated as an
open wound.  The calf
portion of the left lower
extremity incision also
has a narrow zone of
superficial skin slough
which was gently
debrided.  The graft is
not exposed and there are
no deep wounds in the
leg.
 
Mr. Branche's left lower
extremity bypass graft is
functioning well.
However, he will require
significant ongoing wound
care for the immediate
future.  Daily dressing
changes will be arranged
with visiting nurse
services.  We plan to
follow him closely and an
appointment was given for
two weeks.
 
Thanks again for allowing
us to participate in the
care of this delightful
and challenging patient
and please don't hesitate
to contact me at any time
if I can

RE:IRENE YARBROUGH
CDH#810 86 43 7
 
Dear Dr. Shirley:
 
Thank you for referring Irene Yarbrough for evaluation of her atrial fibrillation.  
Mrs. Yarbrough is 55 years old.  Over the past year she had had menorrhagia and 
underwent endometrial biopsy in September of 2078 followed by total abdominal 
hysterectomy in early October of 2078.  Her post-operative course was 
complicated by a pelvic abscess for which she was rehospitalized in late 
October and during that hospitalization had an episode of atrial fibrillation 
which reverted spontaneously to sinus rhythm.  The episode was accompanied by 
some substernal chest heaviness but no other symptoms and she was not aware of 
any palpitations.  She was placed on verapamil 240 mg daily and has not had 
any symptomatic recurrences.  Her abdominal incision is open but healing and 
she has been recovering well.  She has no prior cardiac history.  She 
specifically denies any exertional chest pain, palpitations, or transient 
neurologic symptoms.  She can climb a flight of stairs at her own pace but is 
mildly dyspneic at the top of the stairs.  She feels that her exertional 
capacity has increased somewhat over the past year and a half since she 
stopped smoking.  She does not have a known history of hypertension, however 
VNA has been documenting blood pressures in the range of 130 to 190 mm Hg 
systolic with diastolic pressures ranging from 72 to 110 mm Hg despite therapy 
with verapamil.  There is no prior history of syncope.
 
Page Two
RE:IRENE YARBROUGH
CDH#810 86 43 7
November 10, 2078
 
 
 
Her current medications are verapamil 240 mg daily as above and Premarin.  She 
has GI intolerance to several analgesic medications.  She previously smoked 
two packs per day but quit a year and a half ago of her own volition without 
any particular change in her health precipitating this.  She rarely drinks 
ethanol.  She has not had any prior surgeries.  
 
Family history is negative for premature coronary artery disease.  Review of 
systems is negative for thyroid disease and a TSH was normal during her last 
admission.
 
Physical examination reveals a healthy-appearing obese woman sitting 
comfortably with a blood pressure of 140/90, heart rate 73 and regular.  HEENT 
is externally unremarkable.  There is no lid lag and no thyromegaly.  Carotids 
are palpable bilaterally. Lungs are clear to auscultation.  Cardiac exam 
reveals somewhat distant heart tones and I am not able to palpate the apical 
impulse.  There is a soft systolic murmur at the left sternal border.  Abdomen 
is soft and nontender.  There is a healing surgical incision in the lower 
abdomen.  Extremities are without edema.  Dorsalis pedis pulses are easily 
palpable.
 
The 12-lead electrocardiogram shows sinus rhythm at 73 bpm with a PR interval 
of .18, QRS .08.  There are low amplitude T waves in the lateral precordium 
and inverted T waves in I and aVL with slightly leftward axis.  An 
echocardiogram performed during her last hospitalization was normal, although 
with some mild evidence of ventricular hypertrophy.
 
My impression is that Ms. Yarbrough has had one episode of atrial fibrillation in 
the perioperative period.  She probably has mild labile hypertension which has 
not been previously treated.  This would explain her electrocardiographic 
changes and the echocardiogram as well as the possible predisposition to 
atrial fibrillation.  I took the liberty of switching her from verapamil 240 
mg daily to atenolol 50 mg daily.  Once her incision is further healed we will 
arrange for her to have an exercise tolerance test to get some reassurance 
regarding the possible co-existence of coronary artery disease in view of her 
mild electrocardiographic abnormalities in atrial fibrillation.

CDH#810 86 43 7

will see her again in six weeks at which time she will have the exercise 
tolerance test.  We cautioned her to take her pulse on a daily basis and 
report to us if it becomes irregular and rapid.  We also gave her a 
prescription for nitroglycerin 0.4 mg and instructions on how to take this 
medication in the event of a recurrence of the substernal chest discomfort 
which accompanied her transient atrial fibrillation.
 
Thank you very much for allowing me to participate in her care.
 
Sincerely,

Dear Dr. Van:

I had the pleasure of participating in the care of VivianLee Jorgenson during her recent hospitalization at Goulds Hospital.  This lovely 67-year-old female ended up having no discernable coronary artery disease on catheterization.  At the time of the cath, her pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was 12.  During the course of her hospitalization, we noted as well that she had had runs of nonsustained VT and asked our EP colleagues to comment on the appropriateness of an ICD.  They felt that this could certainly be rediscussed in the future, but at the present time, there was no compelling indication for her to receive an ICD.

Her medications at discharge include Lipitor 20 mg p.o. q.d., digoxin 0.25 mg p.o. q.d., captopril 50 mg p.o. t.i.d., Lasix 40 mg p.o. b.i.d., enteric-coated aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d., Nexium 20 mg p.o. q.d., Synthroid 300 mcg p.o. q.d., Aldactone 25 mg p.o. q.d., Coreg 25 mg p.o. b.i.d., and Norvasc 5 mg p.o. q.d.

It has been a delight to participate in the care of this lovely woman.  If there is any questions or issues, please feel free to call.

Sincerely,

REASON FOR VISIT:  Follow up with Mr. Derek Moss who is here with his son and daughter-in-law with multiple problems and for preop check of electrolytes.  Mr. Moss is 78 years old.

MEDICAL PROBLEM LIST:
1.  Diabetes mellitus type 2, insulin dependent.
2.  Left shoulder pain.  Scheduled for surgical care tomorrow.
3.  GI bleeding, ongoing.
4.  Parkinson's disease.
5.  Fatigue.
6.  BCE.

MEDICATIONS:  Medication list updated on the LMR.  Major change is furosemide now 60 mg b.i.d. instead of 80.

INTERIM HISTORY:
1.  Hyperkalemia occurred on higher dose of Lasix.  Apparently this has been a problem in the past.  He also bumped his creatinine to 2.3.  Potassium rechecked today and is now down to 5.1, stable creatinine.
2.  Diabetes.  Blood sugars running in the 80s in the morning, higher later in the day on 16 units of Lantus sliding scale to cover other meals.  Uses regular insulin about twice a day.
3.  GI bleeding ongoing by Mr. Moss's report, still having clots of blood, no abdominal pain, has not had GI follow up recently, is off Coumadin prior to shoulder repair.
3.  Skin lesions, one on his left leg, one on his right medial leg and a lump on his back noticed by his daughter when she was giving him a therapeutic massage.
4.  Left shoulder pain.  Scheduled for surgery in the a.m.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  He is brighter, cheerier, acutely oriented.  No acute pain.  Vital Signs:  Blood pressure 126/57, pulse 66 and regular, respirations 12 and unlabored, weight 161.  Skin shows seborrheic keratoses, actinic keratoses on the right leg, papule with eschar on the left leg, a subcutaneous nodule on the right upper back.  Chest is clear P&A.  Cardiac exam regular rate and rhythm, normal S1, S2, II/IV apical systolic murmur radiating to the left sternal border.  No gallop.  Extremities, trace edema.  Decreased ROM R shoulder.  Abdomen soft.  Neurologic, alert and oriented.

IMPRESSION AND PLAN:  Hyperkalemia resolving.  Discussed importance of careful fluid balance, low-protein diet given azotemia, renal follow up, follow up with GI for GI bleeding, blood transfusions are available.  Continue lower dose of Lasix.  Skin lesions include seborrheic dermatitis, seborrheic keratoses, possible lipoma, although lump on his back is firm and may need a biopsy once he has recovered from shoulder surgery.  Long consultation with him and his daughter regarding home care after surgery.

EW Neurology Resident Consult Note



Patient Name:	Yusuf, Russell			MRN: 1423602

Date:	7/01/76					  

Consult question: evaluate for stroke/TIA

HPI: 61 RHM was sitting on the couch watching TV.  At 6p he decided to walk to the store.  When he got outside, he had dizziness (lightheadedness, not spinning), and staggering gait.  He went home and sat back down.  When he got up again, he was again unsteady and lightheaded.  When he shuts his eyes, he says he has ""spinning"" sensation.  He took meclizine which did not help.  He has meclizine b/c he has had peripheral vertigo in the past.  He says that the dizziness he had today was different from that.  He had nausea but no vomiting.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Lower extremity cellulitis.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 53-year-old diabetic

vasculopathic with a history of multiple lower extremity arterial

bypass who comes in today with bilateral lower extremity

cellulitis, has diagnosed by her PCP.  She was recently treated

at an outside hospital for bilateral lower extremity cellulitis,

had a 2-day hospital stay, and was discharged home on Keflex. 

She felt that she did have some improvement but over the past 48

hours has had worsening erythema in lower extremities.  She has

also been having some emesis, myalgias and fatigue, but has not

had any hematemesis, abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, or

other symptomatology.  She has also not noticed any urinary

symptoms of frequency.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Peripheral vascular disease, hypertension,

hyperlipidemia, and diabetes.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Amputation to the left second, third and

fifth toes, bilateral fem-pop bypasses right in 2061, left in

2066 and anterior tibial bypass graft in 05/2078.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient works as a Senior Manager of Broadcasting and denies

tobacco, alcohol, or drugs.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Blood pressure 146/66, pulse 98,

respiratory rate 20, temperature 101.2, and O2 saturation 99% on

room air.  General:  This is a well-appearing woman in no

apparent distress.  Respiratory:  Clear to auscultation

bilaterally, no rales, rhonchi, or wheezes.  Cardiovascular: 

Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  GI:  The

abdomen is soft.  The patient does have insulin pump in place,

but has no erythema or fluctuance over the pump.  Skin is warm,

dry, and intact with the exception of the left lower extremity,

which is erythematous, warm and slightly swollen compared to the

right lower extremity.  This erythema stops at the ankle and does

not extend up above the knee.  The patient also has an open

chronic nonhealing wound on the plantar surface of her left foot

as well.  There is no erythema surrounding this wound Neurologic:

 Awake, alert, and oriented x3 except for some decreased

sensation in her left foot, which is chronic.

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  The patient was seen and evaluated

by me and the resident.  I confirm that I have seen and evaluated

the patient, reviewed the resident's documentation on the

patient's chart, and discussed the evaluation, plan of care, and

disposition with the patient as well as the resident.

The patient had a CBC and metabolic panel.  CBC showed white

count of 14 with shift.  LFTs were within normal limits.  X-ray

of her left foot showed no osteomyelitis seen on x-ray and x-ray

of her tib-fib continued to show no osteomyelitis.  Given the

erythema and swelling, I was concerned about a cellulitis in this

vasculopathic who was also diabetic and so we gave her a 1 g of

vancomycin (especially given the fact that she has failed

outpatient therapy with oral antibiotics) and we are admitting

her to the Medicine Service for cellulitis.  The patient's

erythema and swelling does not extend to her foot and would be

extremely atypical for a DVT.  We also notified the Internal Medicine resident of the patient's admission to Medicine as she is

followed closely by Surgery and this notification was

made at 8:30 p.m.

Given the fact that she does not have osteomyelitis at this point

we have not discussed the PICC line and given the fact that she

does not have any ____ abnormalities, I did not believe that she

needs pressors or aggressive hydration and we are starting her on

maintenance fluids, antibiotics, and admitting her to the

hospital.

DIAGNOSIS:  Left lower extremity cellulitis.

CONDITION:  Stable.

DISPOSITION:  Admit to hospital.

Reason for Visit

Sternal pain.



History of Present Illness

71 yo M with CAD, s/p CABG x 4 in 3/80. He presents with pain over the lower part of his chest since Monday-- came on when he was in bed. The pain is located in a specific spot over his breast bone, and is present all the time, worse with coughing, sneezing, or sudden deep breath. No change with exertion-- did his usual exercises (stretching, leg lifts, crunching) yesterday without a problem. No variation with food. No change with position (e.g., leaning forward). Denies productive cough, fever, chills, nausea, diaphoresis, palpitations. No radiation to the jaw or arm. The pain does not remind him of his sx prior to CABG (which he says was exertional SOB), but does feel like his incisional pain after the surgery (which eventually went away completely).

 

ROS as above, otherwise negative in detail. He says his pain is currently gone, and he feels fine lying back in the exam room.

Moist mucous membranes.



      Neck

No visible JVD.

No cervical nodes.



      Chest

Lungs clear, good air movement, no crackles, wheezes. No focal rhonchi. No pleural rub.

+ focal tenderness approx 2-3 cm above the xiphoid-- subcutaneous tissue feels a little thicker here, but no fluctuance, erythema, warmth. No sternal movement wiht palpation. No palpable sternal wire.



      Cor/Cardiac

RRR, + systolic murmur, no rub. ?S4.

      Abdomen

Soft, ND, NT. + bowel sounds.

      Extremity

Warm. No edema.



Lab Test

ECG (today): sinus at 60 bpm, nl axis. IVCD (toward RBBB, but does not meet criteria); inverted Ts in II, III, AVF. Compared with 8/79-- the QRS complex is slightly narrower.



Impression

Sternal pain-- non-exertional, reproducible by palpation, and not accompanied by ECG changes-- in pt who is s/p CABG seven months ago. Sx are different from his original anginal pain-- and I suspect he has some sort of focal inflammation / contusion over the lower part of the sternotomy site. No sign, currently, of local or systemic infection. Doubt pneumonia (no cough or fever, lungs clear) or GI cause. Pericarditis a possibility (he had post-op pericarditis after his CABG), but no signs on ECG, and the pain is not positional.

 

Discussed the case with the pt's cardiologist, Dr. Xavier Rush-- and we came up with the following plan:





Plan

- will send CK/MB/Tn x 1-- although cards agrees that likelihood that this is cardiac seems low

- check CXR

- send ESR, CBC/Diff

- OK for pt to go home after labs drawn and CXR done

- will contact Dr. Thorne's service (cardiac surgery) and Dr. Perez (PCP) to make them aware

- instructed pt to go to the ED immediately for increased pain, SOB, fever, or swelling/redness over the lower sternum

Dear Dr. Barron:


I would like to give you followup on our mutual patient Frances Preston.  As you know, I referred her to the cardiac catheterization laboratory because of progressive worsening angina and a stress test suggesting anterior ischemia.  We performed a catheterization on 12/14/2076.  We utilized the right radial artery for access.  We found that she developed a significant in-stent restenosis lesion within the previously placed Cypher drug-eluting stent.  This is undoubtedly the cause of her symptoms.  We were able to treat this lesion with balloon angioplasty and ultimately stented with a 3.5 x 24 Taxus drug-eluting stent.  The stent was postdilated with a 4 mm noncompliant balloon to high pressure.  The final angiographic result was excellent.


The following morning she was doing quite well and we discharged her later in the day.  She will remain on her usual medications and I have stressed the importance of remaining on aspirin once a day for the remainder of her life and Plavix for a minimum of a year after this procedure, though I will likely favor indefinite therapy.


I plan on seeing her again on 01/24/2077 in followup.  If you have any further questions regarding her care, please do not hesitate to contact me.


Sincerely,

RE:  Gerald, Marion 

MRN: 48967301 

DOV: 05/18/83



Dear Dr. Olive,



Thanks for asking me to see Marion Gerald who I saw on May 18.  She is 

referred for either fibromyalgia or polymyalgia.  The patient states she is 

currently 60 but was in her usual state of good health until 2065 when she 

developed diffuse chest wall pain and tingling.  This continued to bother her 

and she eventually was treated with steroids.  I am not sure she had a 

diagnosis of PMR or fibromyalgia.  She then was switched to ibuprofen which 

did not work particularly well.  Over this time, she would have intermittent 

episodes with nocturnal discomfort and most recently has increasing pain in 

her palms, back, neck, low back, legs, and into her arms.  She was seen by 

Dr. Zink at Barr Clinic, and no blood studies were obtained, but she states 

she had ""25 shots"" of steroids.  She denies any hot or swollen joints.  She 

has had occasional arm swelling but this has resolved.  Extensive ROS reveals 

no photosensitivity but she does have some oral ulcers and Raynaud's.  She 

has urgency regarding her bladder and has been evaluated but not particularly 

well.  She has continued to be concerned about that.  She has had fevers or 

chills but no temperature elevation.  She has intermittent abdominal pain but 

has had a colonoscopy two years ago and was evaluated for this.  She has 

morning stiffness of about an hour and nocturnal pain through the night.



Family history is otherwise remarkable for diabetes in her father.  Mother is 

85.  Two sons alive and well.  Two siblings alive and well except for 

hypertension and hypercholesterolemia.



Past medical history is pertinent for above.  She has had a partial 

hysterectomy, cholecystectomy, and fracture of her wrist.  Medications 

include for hypertension, diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia, the following: 

metformin 500 b.i.d., verapamil 240 b.i.d., Avapro 150 q.d., Pravachol 20 mg 

q.d., Bumex 20 q.d., cyclobenzaprine 10 q.d., Prilosec 20 q.d., and Allegra.  

No smoking or drinking history.  No allergies.  No other medical problems.



Social history is pertinent in that she lives in Elizabethtown.  She works as a 

midwife and director of Iowa Birth Clinic.  Her husband is 

a Broadcast Technician.  They have traveled quite a bit because of this.

Physical reveals a very pleasant woman in no distress.  Weight 152.  BP 

120/80.  She had a respiratory rate of 16.  She had full range of motion of 

all of her joints with tenderness in epicondyles, greater trochanters, and 

cervical and lumbar area.  Otherwise, no active synovitis or skin lesions.  

No oral ulcerations.  Good salivary pool.  No lymphadenopathy, thyromegaly, 

or axillary adenopathy.  Chest: clear to A&P.  No carotid bruits.  Vascular 

exam: normal.  Cardiac exam: quiet precordium without murmur or gallop.  

Abdominal exam: nontender without hepatosplenomegaly.  Extremities: without 

edema.



I suspect she has fibromyalgia.  I do not really know the place of steroids 

in this setting.  I will obtain chemistry profile including CPK, LFTs, TSH, 

CBC, ESR, as well as a urine, ANA, CRP, and RF.  I will see her back in four 

to six weeks.  She will get old records for me to review.  We will talk about 

what therapeutic interventions we may take at that time, but I really need to 

have more information because at this point her symptoms are rather benign.  

I will be in touch with her regarding these results as they come in.



Sincerely yours,

Dear Dr. Huerta:



Reason for visit:

   Today, I had the pleasure of seeing Irving Vera in Cardiology clinic. He is a former patient of Dr. Ilya Light. He is a 59-year-old man with diabetes type 2, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and mild coronary artery disease who had a brief episode of atrial flutter in 2069. He presented in 2069 with chest pain and rapid heart rate following snow shoveling. He was found to be in atrial flutter with a rapid ventricular response. He was cardioverted two days later and has remained in sinus rhythm since then. Echocardiogram performed on 02/22/2069 showed normal ejection fraction of 72%, borderline left atrium at 43 mm, and no significant valvular abnormalities. Stress test performed on 03/16/2069 showed 5 minutes of exercise, 7 METS, and a peak double product of 22, 000. He had no EKG changes, and a small mild posterobasilar defect suggestive of a very limited area of mild ischemia. The patient has been managed medically since then. He has used an event monitor and since then has not had any subsequent episodes of atrial flutter or fibrillation.



The patient has been doing well over the past several months. Currently, he exercises once or twice a week by swimming 30 minutes in a pool. A few months ago, he was exercising almost everyday. His weight has been up and down. He does not complain of any chest pain, shortness of breath, or other symptoms. Occasionally in the morning when he takes his pulse, he notices a skipped beat. I have reassured him that this is not a cause for concern.



Past medical history:

   Diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, atrial flutter as above, coronary artery disease as above, Bell's palsy with residual left eye tearing, kidney stones, and glaucoma.



Current Medications:

  lisinopril 20 mg QD

 Glucophage 1 g BID

 glyburide 10 mg BID

 atenolol 50 mg QAM; Dir: and 25 mg QPM

 Lopid 600 mg BID

 allopurinol 300 mg QD

 omeprazole 20 mg QD

 aspirin 81 mg QD

 Pravachol 80 mg QD

 Avandia 8 mg QD



Allergies:

Penicillin allergy   Penicillin and erythromycin, causing rash.



Family history:

   Not significant for coronary artery disease.



Social history:

   Former tobacco user, works part time in securities.



Review of systems:

   As above, otherwise negative.



Physical examination:

-Pulse:   60

-General:   Obese talkative man in no distress

-Chest:   Lungs are clear bilaterally

-Cardiac:   JVP is 7 cm with normal waveform.  PMI is discrete and nondisplaced.  Regular rate and rhythm with normal S1 and S2.  Soft 2/6 holosystolic murmur heard at the lower left sternal border

-Abdomen:   Obese and tender

-Extremities:   Have trace edema with chronic venous stasis changes



Selected recent labs:

   On 06/18/2070, total cholesterol 168, triglycerides 104, HDL 38, and LDL 109.  His Pravachol dose has been increased since this time.



Assessment and plan:

   This is a 59-year-old man with metabolic syndrome, diabetes type 2, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, obesity, and mild coronary artery disease that has been medically managed. He is doing well. He had an episode of atrial flutter for two days in 2069 but has not had any repeat episodes. He is currently not anticoagulated. Given new recommendations, his target LDL should be less than 70. He is due for a fasting lipid profile in one week. If his LDL is not below 70, then he should either be switched to Lipitor 80 mg day or Zetia should be added to his present regimen. He is slightly hypertensive today with a blood pressure of 140/75. The patient will check his blood pressure at home since he is somewhat anxious male. In the office today, if his blood pressure remains elevated, then I will increase his lisinopril to 30 mg a day. Otherwise, he is doing very well without any cardiac symptoms.

Record date: 2067-08-02

60 year old gentleman presents for follow-up of right lower extremity foot ulcer.  It would appear that two weeks prior, the patient sustained a burn to the right lower extremity while walking on a hot sandy beach.  He has been followed regularly by a podiatrist Dr. Sanchez, who has attempted debridement of lesion.  He also asked that the patient receive vancomycin at the time of his dialysis.

In the setting of four compliance and poor wound healing, the patient was admitted for 48 hours to the Northport Veterans Hospital.  Records are not immediately available but it would appear that he received intravenous antibiotics at that time.  He was discharged without clear follow-up.

The patient presents to my office with his foot unwrapped and undressed.  He has been ambulating on the wound.  He reports that it appears less red and has less drainage than at his initial presentation.  He reports no pain.

Having spoken with his podiatrist, it would appear that the patient has been noncompliant with leg elevation and dressing overall.

It is unclear if there is significant tracking beneath the surface.  A 3 cm x 2 cm flat based ulcer with surrounding callus formation is noted to be ball of the right foot with some granulation and no drainage.  A collar is noted.  No surrounding erythema is appreciated.  Dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses are palpable but clearly diminished.

Assessment and plan: This is a 60 year old gentleman with multiple medical issues including end-stage renal disease my for regurgitation, congestive heart failure, severe peripheral neuropathy, diabetes.  Present in with two large altars to the right lower extremity.  He is status post hospitalization and some debridement and appears to have had little overall improvement in clinical status.  I will proceed with an aggressive outpatient treatment plan however I suspect that he will need inpatient admission once again if significant improvement is not rapidly obtained.  A referral has been made to the Island Medical Center wound clinic for this Tuesday.  Visiting nurse has been arranged for his home for wound care in the interim.  He is advised to avoid all weight-bearing and to keep his foot dressed at all times.  I have explained to the patient that he is at risk of amputation of at least his right great toe should his healing not improve.

With regards to his other medical issues, he continues on dialysis.  I have asked for a hemoglobin A1c and fasting cholesterol to be drawn at the time of his dialysis tomorrow.  I'll see the patient on Tuesday.  

His blood pressure is appropriately controlled and he is no stigmata of congestive heart failure

At today's visit, the patient's wound was dressed and cleaned the our nursing staff

The patient was seen and examined in the Emergency Department on

08/15/2087.  The patient was seen by Dr. Kaminski.  I have discussed

the management with her.  I have also seen the patient personally

and reviewed the medical record.  This is an addendum to the

medical record.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 50-year-old female who is

sent in by her primary doctor after having had EKG changes today.

 Her history, which I personally obtained and in review of the

record, she has a history of sarcoidosis, recently has had

increased cough and some shortness of breath, given albuterol

with symptomatic improvement yesterday and returned today with

some persistent pain, which she says is generally related to

cough.  She has had no fevers, chills, or shortness of breath.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  As indicated and otherwise negative.  She is

asymptomatic at this time.  She has had no recent travel.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Diabetes.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She is a nonsmoker.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient is very well appearing,

pleasant and in no acute distress.  Her vital signs are stable. 

She is normocephalic, atraumatic.  Pharynx and ENT is normal. 

Neck is supple and nontender.  Chest is clear.  Heart is regular

with normal pulses.  Abdomen is soft and nontender without masses

that are appreciated.  Skin is warm and dry.  She has no CVA

tenderness, no back tenderness.  She is awake, alert, and

oriented.  Sensory and motor exam are normal.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  This is a woman who complains of having had

some chest discomfort.  She has a history of sarcoid and has EKG,

which I reviewed, which shows lateral T-wave changes as suggested

by her referring doctor.  She is pain free.  Initial lab results

show hematocrit of 40, INR of 1, and a troponin which was

negative.

Plan at this time is for hospital admission to rule out MI given

her EKG change.  She looks clinically stable.

John Ussery, M.D.

Worthington Internal Medicine

28 Shattuck Street, IM 270

Citrus Ridge, MT 43782



Dear Dr. Ussery:



I saw Mr. Urban in follow-up in the office today.  Since his last visit in November, he has been feeling well.  He has had no angina, no exertional dyspnea, no shortness of breath, no orthopnea, no paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, no palpitations, and no other symptoms of note.  Since his last visit with me, he has participated in and completed outpatient cardiac rehabilitation.  He found this program to be very helpful; he sis very well with the program.  He is currently exercising on a regular basis and has no chest discomfort of dyspnea with exercise.  He has stopped smoking.  There have been no difficulties with his medications.  



On 03/16/2094, he had a follow-up echocardiogram done; this study shows an LV ejection fraction of 37% with septal hypokinesis and inferoposterior akinesis; there is trace mitral regurgitation; and aortic sclerosis, but no stenosis.  Notably, he has a right ventricular systolic pressure estimated to be 46 mmHg with a right ventricle that is mildly dilated and mildly-to-moderately hypokinetic.  He has been feeling quite well and has no other symptoms.



His review of systems is as above and is otherwise negative in detail.



Medications:

Aspirin 325 mg daily

Plavix 75 mg daily 

Lipitor 40 mg daily

lisinopril 10 mg daily

Coreg 6.25 mg daily.





Physical examination:

He appears quite well and is in no apparent distress.  His blood pressure is 112/60 mmHg and his pulse rate is 50 beats per minutes and regular.  His JVP is 7 cm of water with no Kussmaul's sign.  His chest is clear to auscultation bilaterally.  His heart is regular in rhythm and rate with a normal S1 and S2.  He has no S3 or S4 gallop and no audible murmurs.  His abdomen is soft.  It is neither tender nor distended.  He has normal bowel sounds.  His extremities are warm and well perfused.  He has no edema.



Impression:  This is a 50 year-old man with coronary disease who suffered an inferoposterior myocardial infarction in July 2093.  Additionally, he was also found to have cardiomyopathy with an LV ejection fraction of 37 percent.  He is currently asymptomatic from his coronary disease and his LV dysfunction.  Notably, his last echocardiogram shows that he has increased RV systolic pressure and some early right ventricular dysfunction.  The etiology of this right ventricular dysfunction is not clear.  There is likely a component of left heart failure.  In addition, he may have right heart failure out-of-proportion to left heart failure: he has a longstanding smoking history and may have a degree of COPD and, lastly, he may have obstructive sleep apnea.  He reports to me that he does snore at night, and his first wife in Georgia had told him for many years that during the night he had periods were he would stop breathing.  This raises obstructive sleep apnea as a consideration.  



Recommendations: Initially, I am going to start him on Lasix 20 mg daily to lower his preload to help with any component of LV failure that is leading to this.  The rest of his regimen is quite good, and I intend to continue them.  To help to see if there is any component of cor pulmonale that may be contributing to this, I am going to obtain first a chest x-ray, secondly a pulmonary function testing, and lastly a sleep study.  If indeed we find components of obstructive lung disease or obstructive sleep apnea, we will have him see a pulmonologist and treat these accordingly.  I will see him again in six months' time.



Thank you for allowing me to participate in the care of this pleasant gentleman.



Regards,

Past medical history

			

  1. Paraplegia- On 10/06 the patient had a lumbar laminectomy for sciatica. His sciatical pain improved until 5/07 when he developed proximal leg weakness. By 7/07 the patient was bound to a wheelchair. Orginally an extensive workup suggested that the patient had an extramedullary tumor from T8-T12. However all biopsies were inconclusive. The patient subsequently received a T10 laminectomy on 9/09 that revealed Spinal Vascular Malformation but no tumor. The patient received serial MRI's until 12/14 that were able to demonstrate no ""recurrent"" tumors.

2. DMII-first diagnosed in 2113

3. HTN

4. Recurrent UTI's

5. PSA of 6.6

6. Flap 3 Closure Surgery-patient says that he received this surgery to correct damage to his skin caused by his multiple back surgeries

2070's received surgery for shrapnel removal

7. Sacral decubitus ulcers

Assessment and plan

			

  The patient is a 74 year old male, with a past medical history of paraplegia (due to spinal ischemia), DMII, HTN, and recurrent UTI's, who came in for a follow up visit. 



			

1. Diabetes 

-spoke with the patient about his diabetes control. He understands that his hemoglobin A1C is 8.4. However, he doesnt want to start insulin (inconvenient) and actos (the expense). Our plan is to check another hemoglobin A1C since his diet has improved. Will consider starting low dose glypizide if hem A1C still grossly elevated

-current regiment is metformin 1000mg bid -HemA1C 2/22 was 8.5 

-patient sees an opthamologist yearly 

-patient saw a podiatrist in 1/22 

-patient on lipitor 20 -> 9/21 lipid panel Cholesterol 147, LDL 67, HDL 42 

-patient is taking ASA 

-patient is on a MVI 



			

2. HTN 

-spoke with the patient about the fact that his SBP is 130-135. He said that he would like to hold off on advancing treatment for now

-for now will continue Zestril 20mg qd and atenolol 25mg po qd

-current regiment is atenolol 25qd and Zestril 10mg qd   



			

3. Sacral decibutus ulcer 

-patient says that the wound has healed  



4. Paraplegia 

-on neurontin for neuropathic pain control 

-WILL CONSIDER increase the dosage



			

5.Recurent UTI 

-Will not give prophylaxis for recurrent UTI's. Also, will not treat patient unless he has systemic symptoms of fevers or there is a great increase in the amount of burning he has on urination 



			

6. Elevated PSA 

-urology felt that in light of stability of PSA and patient's desire not be biopsied that no intervention should occur at this time. 

-urology wants to see the patient annually. Spoke with the patient again about this today. He doesnt want to see urology again and doesnt want a rectal exam.



			

7. Anxiety 

-well controlled, will continue the Zanax 



			

8. Health Maintenance 

-patient has received pneumovac 

-last colonoscopy was on 12/18 

-gave the patient a flu vaccine (9/22) (Lot BDIKB454QH and expiration 7/3/23)



			

Return to clinic in 2 months (spoke to patient about him coming more frequently but he says that it is very difficult to come in so he'll do the best he can)



Addendum

			



			

I was present during key portions of the evaluation of the patient and agree with John Ross's findings and plan as written.  Pt. is thin, has gotten maximum benefit from metformin so options include sulfonyurea or insulin.

HESS,CLARENCE H   643-65-59-5                 VISIT DATE: 10/11/60
HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  The patient is a 46 year old male 
with complaints of chest pain and throat tightness.  The patient 
reported that he was stuck in traffic for about 12 hours last night 
and apparently got very tense.  He felt some heat from his car, 
thought that it was overheating, and then developed some chest pain 
and throat tightness.  He really described what seems to be 
fleeting chest tightness and no diaphoresis, no shortness of 
breath, and no arm numbness or tingling.  However, he did have one 
associated symptom of some throat tightness. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  The patient has had a stress test one year 
ago that was normal.  He had an echocardiogram at that time that 
was also normal. 
MEDICATIONS:  Claritin, Proventil, and cimetidine. 
ALLERGIES:  Morphine sulfate. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  VITAL SIGNS:  The patient is afebrile. 
Vital signs are normal.  HEENT:  Normal.  NECK:  Supple.  LUNGS: 
Clear bilaterally.  CARDIAC:  Regular rate and rhythm without 
murmur.  ABDOMEN:  Soft and non-tender.  EXTREMITIES:  Negative. 
No CVA tenderness. 
LABORATORY EVALUATION:  EKG shows normal sinus rhythm.  There is no 
change in his electrocardiogram.  Chest x-ray is clear.  CK is 155. 
Troponin is 0.13.  Electrolytes are normal.  BUN and creatinine are 
20 and 1.0.  Hematocrit is 39, white count normal. 
THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  The patient is a 46 year old male 
with a fleeting episode of chest pain and throat tightness while 
stuck in traffic.  He was seen at Southwest Texas Medical Center and 
then sent here appearing somewhat anxious, with a normal physical 
examination, normal EKG, normal chest x-ray, and normal metabolic 
panel.  Most likely low probability for ischemia.  Risk factors are 
also very low. 
DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):   The patient is 
going to be admitted to the Short Stay Unit for a rule out MI 
protocol and possibly for another ETT.

Studies

EKG-NSR, dynamic t-wave changes anterior, ~1mm ST elevation worse than prior v4-v5

CXR:  Vascular congestion. 







Impression and Plan:  58 year old man with PVD, likely CAD but no available ischemic work-up. Resp decompensation likely secondary to pulmonary edema in the setting of volume load. There is some question as to what to do about EKG changes and mild troponin elevations. No definite ST elevations, but elevation in troponin does seem to be too soon to be directly attributable to flash pulmonary edema and resultant demand. Follow enzymes,  heparinize both for ?ischemia and for PVD with sheath in place. As not lilely ACS, not emergent indication for cath, but he was scheduled for elective cath 12/08 and likely would benefit from expedited diagnosis. 



Pump - intubated, diruesis as allowed by pressure (JVP up, some edema of CXR). Started on peripheral dopa, but this is at least partially related to sedation. 



Rhythm - Bradycardia, no acute issues



Iscenmia - Demand ischemia vs NSTEMI. Follow markers. Likely to cath today where it is propble he will have 3vd and require CT surg consult.  Have request FMC records. 



Heme - FFP + lasix prior to cath. Heparin, 



Resp -  Wean vent post cath/OP





Prophy - Heparin/nexium/peridex while vented.

	CARDIOLOGY
	

	PRIMGHAR CARE CENTER
	


	Reason for visit:
   Elective cardiac catheterization prior to CABG


	Interval History:
   Cardiology admission note for Dr. Ickes 
This is an 82 year old male with CAD, DM, HTN, hyperlipidemia, and CRI who presents for elective cardiac catheterization for reevaluation of an RCA stent, which was placed in 12/95 in the setting of an STEMI. This catheterization is in preparation for planned CABG by Dr. Xaysana on 4/23/96. 

Mr. Jarvis's cardiac history began in 12/95, when he was shoveling snow.  At that time, he developed dizziness, diaphoresis and nausea. He went inside and had an episode of syncope which lasted approximately 5 minutes. His initial EKG showed 1 mm STE in II, III and aVF and 1 mm STE in V5 and V6. An EKG seven minutes later showed an increase in STE in the inferior leads and STE in V3 to V6 with a max of 4 mm in V3. He never developed chest pain. An emergent cardiac catheterization at that time showed a left main with minor distal disease. The LAD had a proximal 80% stenosis. The LCx had mid 40% diffuse disease. The 1st OM had a tandem lesion of 90%. The RCA was large and dominant and had a proximal ulcerated 90% stenosis with haziness. Given these findings, a 2.5 X 15mm BMS was placed into the proximal RCA with and excellent result. His peak CK was 305 during that admission. An echo performed at that time was a technically difficult study, which showed diffuse inferior hypokinesis. He was discharged home in 12/95 in stable condition and follow-up with Dr. Xaysana in his office to discuss possible CABG. It was decided that the patient should have a repeat cardiac catheterization prior to the CABG to determine whether RCA restenosis is present. He is then scheduled to have CABG with Dr. Xaysana on 4/23/96. 

The patient has been feeling well at home from a cardiac standpoint. He denies any chest pain, dyspnea, dizziness, pedal edema, orthopnea, PND, or syncope. He does report some bilateral thigh claudication, noting that he can walk about 0.5 miles before he has to stop secondary to leg pain. He denies any calf pain.

	Assessment and plan:
   This is an 82 year old male with CAD, HTN, hyperlipidemia, DM, and CRI who is s/p BMS to the RCA with residual 3-vessel disease who presents for elective cardiac catheterization for evaluation of the RCA stent prior to planned CABG next week. 
-Proceed with cardiac catheterization today 
- He will be premedicated with Mucomyst and Bicarb. given his renal function. 
-Continue ASA and statin 
-Will need to stop Plavix given upcoming surgery next week. 
-BP borderline high today- will monitor during the procedure, adjusting his medications as needed.

HPI:  82M w/ h/o HTN, CRI, DM2 and + h/o smoking w/ no known CAD p/w syncope and an inferior STEMI. Pt has been in his USOH.  This AM while shoveling snow he started to feel &#8220;unwell&#8221; c/o dizziness, slightly nauseous and sweaty.  He denied CP, SOB/V/diaphoresis. He may have had a similar event 3 years ago during heavy exertion (1 episode).  He felt this was like prior hypoglycemic episodes.  Pt went inside, called for his wife and then syncopized. Estimated total LOC ~5 min.  He awoke as his wife returned to give him the OJ and felt completely better after drinking it. arrived to find the pt with STEMI in inf leads. Pt was given asa and was taken to the ED for further management. 


ED course: Pt was bradycardic but hemodynamically stable P59, BP112/63). He was found to have a new RBBB and new STE in 2, 3, avf and V3-V6 with depressions in 1, avl. Pt had no chest pain through out the entire duration, but felt generally unwell. Was started on heparin, lipitor, NAC and cardiology was called. 


Pt was taken to the cath lab and found to have 3VD w/ severe proximal LAD lesion, a diffusely diseased Cx/OM2, and a severe RCA lesion, which was felt to be the culprit. A BMS to RCA lesion. Pt was plavix loaded and started on a bicarb drip.

Visit Note

Patient Name:  WERNER, BRIAN U                       MRN:  4097229
Dictated Date:  01/20/2120                        Dictated by:  Taniya Xing, M.D.

Date of Visit:  01/20/2120


Bryan returns for followup of cerebrovascular disease. A lot has happened since I last saw him in 10/2119. A CTA revealed severe stenosis of his left ICA. He is status post bilateral carotid endarterectomies and also has known vertebral disease with a history of a left occipital stroke. He subsequently was referred to Dr. Mccarthy and was scheduled to undergo left ICA stent placement in December. In November 1 morning after going to the bathroom he developed sudden onset of vertigo. His wife called 911. He continued to have positional vertigo in the emergency room such that if he sat up he would become very vertiginous and off balance but if he laid with his eyes closed. He felt better. He was found to be orthostatic and his symptoms improved according to the chart by the next day though according to the patient, it took a couple of days for his symptoms to improve significantly. An MRI of the brain was unrevealing for ischemia. Although he significantly improved he still feels &#34;a little off balance&#34;.  He is fine when he is sitting but he notes when he stands up he just &#34;feels off&#34;.  He does not feel acutely vertiginous and does not have any sense of movement but does not feel as steady as he used to on his feet. He has seen Guy in physical therapy and is working on balance therapy. He subsequently did undergo left ICA stent placement on 12/22/2119 without any complication. There was no worsening of his sense of imbalance or no new neurologic symptoms. Also of note, I neglected to mention above, that when he became acutely vertiginous in November there were no other accompanying symptoms. He was discharged after his left carotid endarterectomy on Plavix as well as aspirin that he had been on prior to his admission. He also was switched while in the hospital from hydrochlorothiazide to Inderal for blood pressure control although he was orthostatic sitting up.  Lying down he was hypertensive. He has had no new neurologic symptoms since his discharge from NDMG after his carotid endarterectomy on 12/22/2119. 

CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Aspirin, gemfibrozil, nifedipine, Plavix, propranolol, ranitidine. 

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Pleasant, healthy-appearing 74-year-old male. Blood pressure 160/90 sitting, standing 155/90. Cranial nerve examination notable for right homonymous hemianopsia. Auscultation of the neck: Unremarkable. No bruits. There are bilateral CEA scars. Motor examination: No drift. Power 5/5 throughout. Fine finger movements intact. In the lower extremities. Power 5/5 on the right. The left he is status post left knee fusion. The left iliopsoas and dorsiflexion are full strength. His gait shows left limp due to knee fusion, but he appears steady. DTRs 1+ throughout. 

DATA: MRI of the brain in 11/2119 shows chronic left occipital lobe infarct otherwise unremarkable. CTA of the head and neck 11/14/2119 showed stable left PCA territory chronic infarct with encephalomalacia and nonspecific periventricular white matter hypoattenuation as previously described. CTA of the head showed stable moderate stenosis of the left supraclinoid ICA. Stable occlusion or near occlusion of the left vertebral artery at the dural penetration to the take off of the PICA. There is reconstruction of contrast in the distal aspect. There is moderate stenosis of the distal left interdural vertebral artery with severe stenosis at the left vertebrobasilar junction and also unchanged.  Stable moderate to severe stenosis within the right intradural vertebral artery.  Mild areas of stenosis within the basilar artery and left T1 and T2 segments also unchanged. A CTA of the neck shows a short segment of severe stenosis of the proximal left ICA, which is stable since the most recent study.  The right carotid artery demonstrates no significant stenosis. Dominant right vertebral artery with hypoplastic left vertebral artery demonstrates moderate stenosis at its origin and diffuse areas of moderate stenosis of the throughout unchanged. Mild to moderate right subclavian artery stenosis just proximal to the vertebral artery take off unchanged. Multiple thyroid nodules as described since most recent study. New ground glass nodule in the lower lobe the right lung, which is likely inflammatory in nature. Followup chest x-ray 11/14/2119 was unremarkable. Cardiac ultrasound shows evidence of a PFO, which is now noted following performance of Valsalva maneuver not previously noted.  In 09/2113 Holter monitor was unremarkable. 

IMPRESSION: A 74-year-old male with long-standing cerebrovascular disease and history notable for left occipital lobe infarct with vertebrobasilar disease as described above, status post bilateral carotid endarterectomies with recent restenosis on the left treated with stenting in 12/2119.  He has been doing well considering. 

The cause of his episode of vertigo and imbalance is unclear.  It is difficulty to tease out whether or not this was a posterior circulation TIA versus small stroke not detected on MRI versus vasovagal etiology. He checks out well today and I do not find any new findings on examination and his walking is steady though subjectively he feels he is not quite back to baseline. Agree with Plavix added to his aspirin dose after his carotid stent placement. His blood pressure is a little high today. He will be following up with Dr. Kinney in 2 weeks. Recommended that he continue to work with Guy on vestibular therapy. 

Followup with me in 3 months.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Nicholas Xavier is a
76-year-old male who presented to Orlando Regional this
evening for diabetes followup.  He denies any known drug
allergies and at present, he is taking Feratab 300 mg
t.i.d., Motrin 600 mg q.8h. p.r.n., Benadryl 50 mg q.h.s.
p.r.n., Zestril 5 mg q.d., glyburide 2.5 mg q.d., and
aspirin 325 mg q.o.d.  The patient has been followed fairly
frequently in the clinic recently for diabetic foot ulcers
on his right foot, between his 4th and 5th toe.  This
evening, he presents with worsening ulcers in that area and
also a new ulcer between his 3rd and 4th toes.  It has not
improved with good skin care and application of bacitracin;
in fact, it has worsened.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: He denies any bleeding with brushing of
his teeth.  He denies any palpitations or chest pain.  He
denies any shortness of breath or cough.  He denies any
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or constipation.  He states that
his bowel movements have become darkened secondary to his
iron intake.  He denies any symptoms of frequency or
nocturia, no burning, itching, or pain with urination.  He
states that he has occasional elbow pain, which is relieved
with Motrin.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: His temperature is 97.8 degrees, his
pulse is 88, his blood pressure is 135/65, weight is 141
pounds, and his random blood sugar is 159.  He states that
he did not take his medication today.  His heart has a
regular rate and rhythm at 88.  Lungs are clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  There are bruises noted on his
right hand and left upper arm, but he states that both of
these were related to trauma.  Examination of his feet
revealed his toes to be more reddened and somewhat shiny,
shinier than previous visits.  They were cool to touch.  On
his right foot, there was a new dime-sized blister on the
4th toe, and the toe that bordered his 3rd toe, and on the
other side.  There was an increase in the size on the toe
ulcer and also on the ulcer on his 5th toe.  Scant amount of
drainage was noted from the toe areas.  Mr. Nicholas Xavier
is vigilant with his foot care and has been so.  This is
definite worsening of his symptoms.  Posterior tibial pulses
are present.

ASSESSMENT
1. Noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.
2. Diabetic foot ulcers on 4th toe, both sides, and 5th toe.

PLAN: Arterial vascular studies with Doppler imaging to be
done.  Referral to surgical clinic for evaluation of his
ulcers.  He was given a prescription for Xeroform gauze to
be used twice daily and dressing changes were explained to
him.  He was instructed to return to clinic in one month for
followup.

Re:	Russell Urban	

WRH#	4722064	





Dear Dr. Ussery:



I had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Russell Urban in Cardiology Clinic today.  As you know, Mr. Urban is a very pleasant 50-year-old gentleman who on July 09, 2093, while sitting at a concert in Central Park had the sudden onset of feeling    unwell   , epigastric discomfort, and profound diaphoresis.  He came to the Worthington Regional Hospital Emergency Room at that time.  By the time he arrived, his symptoms had abated.  He had an unremarkable electrocardiogram initially and negative cardiac markers, and was admitted to the medicine service to rule-out a myocardial infarction.  That evening, he had recurrent symptoms and was noted to have sustained wide complex tachycardia, which appears to be ventricular tachycardia.  He was transferred to the Cardiac Care Unit for further management.  The next morning, he underwent cardiac ultrasound, which revealed an ejection fraction of 28% and a diffusely hypokinetic left ventricle with an akinetic inferior wall.  Additionally his next set of cardiac markers returned positive.  He therefore went cardiac catheterization revealing a total occlusion of his right coronary artery and minimal non-obstructive disease of the left system.  This artery was stented with total of three stents (two Express stents 2.5 x 24 mm and one Pixel stent 2.5 x 28 mm), encompassing the entire length of the right coronary artery.  A left ventriculogram was performed and demonstrated an ejection fraction of 30% with a diffusely hypokinetic ventricle and and akinetic inferior wall.  He ruled in for myocardial infarction with a peak CK of 1490 and a peak troponin of 2.0.  A follow-up echocardiogram was performed on July 15, 2093. This study showed his ejection fraction had improved to 36%; the left ventricle was diffusely hypokinetic and the inferior wall appeared severely hypokinetic.  His reduced ejection fraction was out of proportion to his degree of coronary disease.  Because of this, a series of laboratory tests were performed which revealed normal iron studies, normal thyroid function, and a normal serum protein electrophoresis pattern. He was discharged in stable condition to follow up with me as an outpatient.



Since his myocardial infarction, Mr. Urban has been feeling quite well.  He has returned to work in the factory where his employed as a manufacturing manager.  He has had no symptoms of angina, dyspnea, nausea, or diaphoresis.  He has felt very well.  He continues to take his medications without difficulty, and denies any symptomatology whatsoever.



His past medical history prior to this hospitalization is largely unremarkable because he had not sought medical care.  Of note, he reports to me that about 8 or 9 years ago while living in Georgia, he presented to an emergency room with some chest discomfort.  He was evaluated and released.  He never had any further testing.  He did not have a stress test, cardiac ultrasound or catheterization.  Prior to his admission, he did not have any known hypertension or hyperlipidemia, but has been diagnosed with these conditions while in the hospital.



His medications include aspirin 325 mg daily, Plavix 75 mg daily, Lipitor 20 mg daily, lisinopril 10 mg daily, and carvedilol 6.25 mg twice each day.  He has no known drug allergies.



Ms. Urban is originally from Nicaragua but after working for Imports, Inc, he moved to Georgia where he lived for 24 years working as a Registered Nurse and in various other positions.  He immigrated to America about a year or so ago.  He has been working in Borders.  He currently lives in Toledo, Montana, with his wife.  He has no children.  He smoked 1 to 1-1/2 packs per day for about 30 years, but has not smoked since his hospitalization.  He drinks only socially and denies illicit drug use.



He has a family history of coronary artery disease in that his father had 3 myocardial infarctions and died at a young age of heart disease.



On physical exam, his blood pressure was 130/82 mmHg in his right arm and 126/80 mmHg in his left arm.  His heart rate is 60 and regular.  In general, he is in no apparent distress.  His jugular venous pressure is 6 cm of water.  His chest is clear to auscultation without rales, wheezes, or rhonchi.  His heart is regular in rhythm and rate with a normal S1 and S2.  He has no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  His abdomen is benign.  His extremities are warm and well perfused and without clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.  On vascular exam his carotid pulses are 2+, brisk and without bruits.  His femoral pulses are 2+, brisk and without bruits.  His right femoral artery was entered for cardiac catheterization.  The site looks clean and intact with no hematoma and no bruit and a strong pulse.  His distal pulses are 2+ and symmetric throughout.



His lipid panel from his hospitalization reveals total cholesterol of 210 mg/dl, LDL of 153 mg/dl, and HDL of 45mg/dl.



His electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm.  He has T wave inversions in III and aVF, and he has a greater than 15 degree disparity between his R and T wave axis.



Mr. Urban underwent a exercise treadmill test with sestamibi imaging yesterday.  He exercised for 10 minutes 43 seconds achieving a maximum workload of 12 METS, and a peak double product of 21,600.  His electrocardiogram was negative for ischemia.  His nuclear images revealed a mild reduction in tracer activity in the inferior wall which persisted after reinjection consistent with his inferior myocardial infarction. There was no evidence of ischemia elsewhere.  His left ventricular ejection fraction was measured at 51%.



In short, Mr. Urban is a 51-year-old who had an inferior myocardial infarction, but interestingly during his hospitalization had systolic dysfunction well out of proportion to his coronary disease.  Also, his systolic function has improved over time.  I think there are two processes going on.  One is coronary artery disease.  Clearly this has manifested itself as an inferior myocardial infarction due to an occluded right coronary artery, which was treated during his hospitalization with stenting.  The other issue is his transient systolic dysfunction that is out of proportion to his coronary artery disease.  Given the rapid improvement in his ejection fraction, I can only speculate as to the etiology of this.  He does not appear to have a persistent cardiomyopathy, but a transient one.  I suspect that this is myocarditis.  Unfortunatley, I have no way of proving this for certain but clinically it seems to fit.  It is possible that whatever led to his myocarditis also triggered his acute coronary syndrome.  



From the aspect of his coronary artery disease, he will continue on aspirin for life.  He received quite a substantial amount of stenting to his right coronary artery, and I would opt to continue his Plavix for at least 12 months.  For his hyperlipidemia, I agree with Lipitor, and we will recheck his lipid profile to see if the dose of Lipitor is adequate.  His LDL goal will be less than 100.  He is well beta-blocked on his carvedilol, and we will continue with the current dose of 6.25 mg twice daily.  His blood pressure allows us to increase his lisinopril from 10 to 15 mg daily.  I will see Mr. Urban again in three months for followup.  I will repeat his echocardiogram in six months' time to see where his ejection fraction has settled out.



Thank you for allowing me to participate in the care of this very interesting and pleasant gentleman.  The patient was seen and examined, and the case was discussed with Dr. Orville Ness.



Sincerely,









Jimmy Orozco, M.D.

ADDENDUM:

The patient had dizzy spells since 12/2099, which resolved after

resection of his cervical medullary tumor.  He had recurrence 3

times this morning of similar episodes.  He feels presyncopal and

has headache.  He denies any nausea, vomiting, fevers, chills or

upper respiratory symptoms.  He has had some epigastric pain. 

During all of these episodes, he never lost consciousness, but he

does a fall and slump.  He feels lightheaded prior to the

episode.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Remarkable for rheumatoid arthritis,

psoriasis, hypertension, cholesterol, and asthma.

Social history, family history, and review of systems are as per

the written note.  The patient was counseled regarding smoking

cessation.

MEDICATIONS:  Aspirin, Lipitor, nifedipine, and Neurontin.

ALLERGIES:  None.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient is awake, alert, in no acute

distress.  Vital signs are remarkable for temperature of 97.3,

pulse 58, respiratory rate 16, blood pressure 134/79, and oxygen

saturation is 96% on room air.  For full physical exam findings,

please see the resident's written notes.  Specifically, HEENT

exam is atraumatic and normal to inspection.  There is minimal

right ptosis on my exam.  Neck is normal, supple, with posterior

well-healed cervical scar.  There is no lymphadenopathy on my

exam.  Respiratory, cardiac, abdominal, skin, and musculoskeletal

exam are within normal limits as documented.  Neurologically, the

patient is oriented with normal pleasant mood and affect.  Speech

is fluent.  Cranial nerves are remarkable only for intermittent

right-sided ptosis.  Extraocular movements are otherwise intact,

and the patient is moving all 4 extremities without any motor or

sensory deficit.

LABORATORY DATA:  CBC and electrolytes are remarkable for BUN and

creatinine ratio of 22-0.9 respectively.  CK and troponin are

flat.  INR is 1.  EKG demonstrates sinus rhythm without any

significant ST-T wave changes when compared to prior studies.

IMAGING STUDIES:  Head CT is unremarkable.

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  The patient with possible

presyncope without EKG changes, nor any evidence for new disease

on his head CT, will undergo consultation by Neurology and

Neurosurgery, and will be admitted to the ED Observation area for

likely MR imaging prior to admission.  The patient if not

admitted to either of the Neurosurgery or Neurology Services will

require admission to the Medicine Service for syncope workup.

 ******** Not reviewed by Attending Physician ********

DISPOSITION:  Admitted to ED Observation Unit.

PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS:  Near syncope.

SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS:  Status post cervical medullary tumor

resection.

Lives in De Soto with Wife and Daughter


ROS
As detailed. He also has been c/o dizziness and weakness after dialysis, which was the main reason he refused to go for HD yesterday. No additional hx is available, no known sick contact per wife. When he was in ED, he was noted to have LGF 100.4, hypertensive and tachycardic. He is waiting for head CT and possible LP.

NAD, limited cooperation with exam, A+O x2
CV: tachy/reg, no rubs
CHEST: CTA ant

Neuro: nonfocal-limited exam

DATAEKG is not available for review, but no acute ischemic changes and no widened QRS/peaked T wave per ED.
PCXR: poor penetration, but no acute process
Head CT       IMPRESSION:

1. No hemorrhage, mass lesion, or evidence of acute territorial
infarction.

2. Extensive nonspecific periventricular, deep, and subcortical
white matter changes are likely sequela from chronic
microangiopathic disease.

3. Old lacunar infarctions in the left caudate head and right
caudate-anterior corona radiata.
Evaluation for acute ischemia is limited in the areas of extensive
white matter disease. Brain MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging
is more sensitive in assessing for acute ischemia and should be
obtained as clinically indicated.

COMPREHENSIVE EXAM. 

PERSONAL DATA AND OVERALL HEALTH:  Now 63, despite his multiple
medical problems, he continues to spend spring in West Virginia and remain
reasonably active.  Wife very helpful in cooking appropriate
meals and helping with day to day issues.  

ONGOING MANAGEMENT/MULTIPLE MEDICAL PROBLEMS:
    1.    Health maintenance.  Eye exam. Continue to recommend annual
    exams with Dr. Ortiz.  Influenza vaccine advised, Winter 89.
    PSA sent.  
    2.    Preventative counseling.  Continues to swim in a pool, no
    alcohol, no cigarettes.  Advised regular skin checks.
    Avoidance of sun.  Rectal exam neg.  Smoking status: none
    smoker.  Stool guaiac test: home with stool guaiac cards.  

PROBLEMS:
    1.    CAD.  He continues to do quite well with no evidence of
    current symptoms of angina.  He is s/p CABG and most
    recently s/p stent distal LCX 10/87.  
    2.    CHF.  He has severe ischemic cardiomyopathy with chronic
    CHF.  His most recent echocardiogram 4/88, showed a severe
    depressed LV systolic function with estimated EF of 30% with
    global hypokinesis and antero-apical akinesis with moderate
    LV enlargement and mild concentric LVH with left atrial
    enlargement, dilated aortic root, mild AI and trace MR. 
    despite this, since getting on a stable dose of Lasix and
    Carvedilol, which was added during his hospitalization for
    CHF in 10/87, he has done well and currently denies symptoms
    of orthopnea, PND or edema.  
    3.    S/P AICD.  He is s/p recent admission to MCH, 6/17 through
    6/19/89 for replacement of his cardiac defibrillator.  He
    did well without complication and he continues to follow up
    Dr. Cook on a regular basis.  He has had no VT, VF, which
    has been symptomatic or which has caused triggering of his
    AICD.  
    4.    S/P DDD pacemaker for sick sinus syndrome, 7/83.  Continues
    to do well, again, with close monitoring by Dr. Cook. 
    5.    Hypertension.  Blood pressure is excellent on current
    regimen and will continue same.

MR #113-14-14                 -2-            June 27, 2089

    6.    Diabetes mellitus.  He continues on oral agents, watching
    his diet and exercising as much as he is able.  He does not
    monitor sugars often but he reports when he does have them
    done, sugars are typically fasting 100-150 and no symptoms
    of hypoglycemia.  Will check HBA1C and urine for micro
    albumin today.  
    7.    Cerebral vascular disease.  He is s/p cerebellar CVA, 7/80
    with mild residual dysarthria and right sided weakness but
    has had no new neurologic events. His most recent carotid
    artery duplex study was from 5/88, showed a 60-80% stenosis
    of the RICA but I don't actually hear a bruit on his exam
    today.  He continues on Coumadin anticoagulation.  
    8.    Hypercholesterolemia.  His most recent lipid profile is
    quite improved with Lipitor with a total cholesterol down to
    136, triglycerides 313, HDL 25, LDL 48 on 6/11/89.
    Unfortunately, since his HDL remains low, which is
    suboptimal, but he has not tolerated Niacin in the past. 
    9.    Peripheral vascular disease. He continues to have bilateral
    femoral bruits and diminished peripheral pulses but because
    of his limited walking ability, he currently has no symptoms
    of claudication. 
    10.   Osteoarthritis. He is s/p left TKR by Dr. Robles last year
    and is now doing quite well.  Notably, he would require
    antibiotic prophylaxis for procedures.  

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  He denies chest pain, shortness of breath,
abdominal pain. He continues to have a rectal fistula.  Last
year, had a negative Barium enema study and several years ago a
sigmoidoscopy because of guaiac positive stool but this is
presumably secondary to the rectal fistula, which intermittently
bleeds.  He has had no recent edema in his legs. His left knee is
doing quite well and he is working to strengthen the thigh
muscles. He has nocturia one time per night. He has stable
impotence, some decreased interest as well as some decreased
ability to have erections, though he can still have a partial
erection. Generalized decreased energy level.  

PHYSICAL EXAM:  Blood pressure:  136/60, pulse: 60 and regular. 
Weight: 181. General: amazingly well appearing.  Skin: no
suspicious lesions.  HEENT: oropharynx edentulous, no lesions. 
Lungs: clear to A&P.  COR:  carotids 2+, no bruits appreciated by
my exam.  JVP flat. Thyroid: no thyromegaly. Nodes: no
adenopathy.  COR:  s/p median sternotomy scar.  Pacer left upper
chest wall. AICD with fresh Steri strips in place. No evidence

of erythema.  Left upper abdomen.  S1, S2, 2/6, HSM,  apex no S3,
or diastolic murmur appreciated.  Abdomen: positive bowel sounds,
soft non tender, no HSM or masses.  Rectal: mildly diffusely
enlarged prostate without nodules, no rectal masses. Stool brown,
guaiac negative.  Extremities:  scar over the left knee, no
peripheral edema.  

DISPOSITION:  Follow up with Opal Fierro.  Flu shot in the
winter, sooner PRN.

EDVISIT^06129040^MACK, ROSE^08/16/92^GRAHAM, ANGELA

This patient's visit was shared with PA, Quiring.  I also

personally interviewed and examined this patient.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 50-year-old female with

past medical history of type 1 diabetes, peripheral vascular

disease, and hypothyroidism who presents for evaluation of an

infected left heel ulcer.  The patient is status post bypass

grafting in her lower extremities and skin grafting of a

nonhealing ulcer on her right heel.  Since that time, she has

developed a chronic nonhealing ulcer on the left heel, which has

been followed closely by VNA.  Today, she was seen by her VNA who

was very concerned about redness and swelling of her left foot

with redness that extended underneath the plantar surface of the

foot and over the dorsal surface and concern for infection of

this ulcer.  The patient has minimal sensation in the left foot. 

She states sometimes she can feel a pressure sensation.  She does

have some pain when she tries to weightbear, has not noted any

fevers, has noted some chills and states that her fingerstick

earlier today was elevated.  She denies any abdominal pain,

nausea, or vomiting.  She does note that her foot does appear to

be somewhat slightly more swollen but has not noticed redness up

until today.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Positive for hypothyroidism, type 1

diabetes, and peripheral vascular disease with a nonhealing

diabetic foot ulcers.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  She is status post femoral bypass

grafting, thyroidectomy, skin grafting for nonhealing wounds, and

right foot debridement in the past.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She smoked in the past, does not drink.  She

lives with family, is followed by a VNA, and is not working.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Reviewed and is also positive for diabetes.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  All other systems reviewed and otherwise

negative except per the HPI.

MEDICATIONS:  Insulin.

ALLERGIES:  She has an allergy to codeine, aspirin, erythromycin,

oxycodone, and sulfa.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Her temperature is 98.6, her pulse 105,

respirations 16, blood pressure 117/70, and O2 saturations are

100% on room air.  The patient is awake, alert, frail, and thin

female.  She is in no respiratory distress.  Her head examination

is normocephalic and atraumatic.  Her conjunctivae are slightly

pale.  She has moist mucous membranes.  The airway is patent. 

Her neck is supple with full range of motion without any pain. 

The trachea is midline.  Her lungs are clear to auscultation

bilaterally with equal breath sounds.  No respiratory distress,

no accessory muscle use, and no chest wall tenderness.  Her

cardiac examination is tachycardic and regular at about 100 with

a 3/6 systolic murmur.  Her abdomen is nondistended, soft, and

nontender.  No guarding and no peritoneal signs.  Her skin is

remarkable for healing superficial ulcers on the right heel.  On

the left heel, she has a superficial ulcer with a dark eschar,

which is approximately 4 x 4 cm in diameter.  There is no

purulent discharge around the area; however, the skin of the left

foot is fairly violaceous and warm on the plantar surface of the

foot surrounding the ulcer extending up the lateral aspect of the

foot to the anterior aspect of the left ankle was demarcated in

the Emergency Department.  There is no other break in the skin

visualized.  Her back is nontender with full range of motion. 

Extremities are remarkable for lower extremity atrophy.  She does

have 1+ edema of both feet.  She has minimal sensation on

palpation of her feet with no obvious tenderness on palpation

over her left foot.  Her pulses are trace.  She is alert and

oriented x3, has a depressed affect.  See the PA note for

remainder of the details of the physical examination.

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  The patient had IV access

initiated.  Laboratory studies were sent including blood

cultures.  She was started on IV antibiotics, vancomycin, and

gentamicin and was consulted to Vascular Surgery.  Her feet

remained elevated.  She had a plain x-ray performed of her foot,

which showed no obvious evidence of osteomyelitis and no

subcutaneous gas.  Her laboratory studies are remarkable for

hyperglycemia and she was started on IV fluids.

DISPOSITION:  She is admitted to Surgery.

DIAGNOSIS:  Left foot, nonhealing ulcer with left foot

cellulitis, and peripheral vascular disease.

See the note for details.

Louis Barron, M.D.
Shelby Dental Care Center

Cozad, OK  53952


Dear Dr. Barron:


Thank you very much for your kind referral of Frances Preston to the Cardiovascular Division of Weston General Hospital.  I saw her in consultation this afternoon for her diagnosis of a recent myocardial infarction.  Please allow me to summarize her history for our records.


Frances is a very pleasant 51-year-old Danish woman who has cardiac risk factors including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and recently diagnosed glucose intolerance.  It appears that she had been having a several-month history of anginal-type symptoms, although a stress test obtained in March showed no significant ischemia.  On 04/09/2076 she was in New York helping a family member with start up of a restaurant, when she woke up in the morning with a sudden onset of chest discomfort and lightheadedness, and according to her daughter suffered a cardiac arrest.  She was taken emergently to Cabrini Medical Center where she was found to have an inferior wall myocardial infarction and underwent coronary stenting.  I do not have records from this admission that she does have her stent cards that indicate that she received a 3.5 x 23 and 3.5 x 13 Cypher drug-eluting stents to the right coronary artery.  Per her daughter's report, she had a significant lesion in another blood vessel, which was felt to require percutaneous coronary intervention.  Unfortunately, we do not have details of the remainder of her coronary anatomy.


Since her myocardial infarction, she actually has felt quite well.  She no longer has the angina that she had prior to her MI.  Her major complaints are that she occasionally feels lightheaded and somewhat fatigued but overall feels well.  She is able to walk normal distances without cardiac symptoms.


Her past medical history is notable for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and glucose intolerance.


Her present medications include aspirin 325 mg a day, Plavix 75 mg a day, metformin 500 mg a day, simvastatin 40 mg a day, nitroglycerin p.r.n., amlodipine 10 mg a day, hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg a day, and lisinopril 20 mg a day.


She has no known drug allergies.


Social History:  She is married and has three children.  She is presently accompanied by her daughter Landis who handles the majority of her health care.  Landis can be reached on a cell phone at 944-351-0904.  She has never used tobacco.


Family history is notable for several aunts with myocardial infarctions and a sister whose has had a prior stroke.  There was a significant history of glucose intolerance in the family.


Review of Systems:  Cardiac:  No chest pain, PND, orthopnea, dyspnea, or lower extremity edema.  Musculoskeletal:  No myalgias or arthralgias on lipid-lowering therapy.  All others are negative.


On physical examination, she is an overweight yet well-appearing female in no apparent distress.  Her blood pressure is 131/86 and her heart rate is 61 beats per minute.  Her weight is 213 pounds.  Her neck shows 2+ carotid upstrokes.  There is a hint of a bruit in the left carotid.  The carotid upstrokes are full.  Her lungs are clear to auscultation.  The heart is normal to palpation, no thrills are palpated and the PMI is nondisplaced.  The heart is regular in rate and rhythm and a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur is heard best in the right upper sternal border throughout the precordium.  The abdomen is obese, soft, nontender with normal bowel sounds.  Her extremities show no edema.


Her EKG in the office today shows normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 61 with a normal axis and intervals.  She has Q waves and T-wave inversions in leads III and F consistent with her recent myocardial infarction.


I do not have a recent lipid profile on file.


On 04/16/2076, she underwent an echocardiogram.  She has normal left ventricular function with a mild intracavitary gradient of 9 mmHg.  She has mild aortic sclerosis with a velocity across the aortic valve of 2.2 m/sec.  There are no significant wall motion abnormalities.  She has only mild mitral regurgitation.


In summary, well we do not have records, it is fairly clear that Mrs. Preston has had an inferior wall myocardial infarction treated with coronary stenting.  She did receive drug-eluting stents.  The good news is that appears that her left ventricular function is very well preserved suggesting that she did not have a large myocardial infarction.  What is less clear, however, is the status of her other coronaries, there is some suggestion that she may have significant coronary artery disease at this time.


From a clinical standpoint, I certainly do not think that she requires a cardiac catheterization at this time.  She is fairly asymptomatic, and is doing well from the cardiovascular standpoint.  I think what would be more helpful in guiding recommendation is whether she has significant underlying ischemia at this point.  To this end, I have arranged for her to undergo an adenosine PET scan to assess for residual ischemia.  We will guide our recommendations regarding cardiac catheterization based on the results of the study.


In terms of her lipids, it appears that she has been switched to Lipitor.  The goal for her LDL should be in the 70s and her HDLs ideally be in the 40s.


In terms of antithrombotic therapy, she did receive drug-eluting stents.  Therefore, she should certainly remain on aspirin for the remainder of her life and Plavix for an absolute minimum of one year.  After a year, it would likely be acceptable for her to stop her Plavix for brief periods of time should it be necessary for other medical procedures.  However, up until that time her Plavix should not be discontinued without a discussion with myself.


She is on a very good medical regimen, although I think she would benefit from a beta-blocker.  The hydrochlorothiazide appears to be a new medication for her, and therefore I went ahead and discontinued this and started her on extended-release metoprolol at 25 mg a day.  This can certainly be cut uptitrated for better blood pressure control.


I will call her daughter Landis with the results of her PET scan and further recommendations, and we will go ahead and make plans for her to see me again in six months.


Thank you for allowing me to participate in her care.  If you have any further questions regarding her management, do not hesitate to contact me.

Dear Dr. Truong:



We had the pleasure of caring for your patient, Mr. Yul Tanner, during his admission to the Floyd County Hospital from 12/19/2092 through 12/20/2092 for diagnostic catheterization.  As you recall, he is a 57-year-old man with a history of diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and obesity, who initially presented with chest discomfort on 12/09/2092.  Mr. Tanner ruled out for myocardial infarction at that time and underwent stress testing, which was positive.  He returns today for diagnostic catheterization.  Cardiac catheterization revealed noncritical coronary artery disease with an approximately 50% ostial right coronary artery lesion in a left dominant system.  The right femoral arteriotomy site was manually compressed without complication.  Mr. Tanner was admitted to the Cardiovascular Unit overnight for observation.  Overnight he did well, specifically, he denied any chest pain, shortness of breath, groin, or flank pain.  He remained hemodynamically stable, and was ambulating, eating, and voiding without difficulty.



On examination, his cardiac exam revealed a regular rate and rhythm with normal S1 and S2.  Lungs were clear to auscultation throughout all lung fields.  His groin was soft and mildly tender with no hematoma and no bruit noted.  His lower extremities were warm and well perfused with intact distal pulses.



His morning labs were significant for sodium of 142, potassium of 4.1, BUN of 18, creatinine of 1.  A CBC revealed a white blood cell count of 4.74, hematocrit of 31.6, and platelets of 304,000.  A fasting lipid panel revealed total cholesterol of 107, triglycerides of 130, HDL of 30, and LDL of 51.



We are planning on discharging Mr. Tanner on the following medications, aspirin 81 mg daily, Lipitor 10 mg daily, diltiazem extended release 360 mg daily, Levoxyl 250 mcg daily, lisinopril 40 mg daily, NPH insulin 80 units subcutaneous daily, Avandia 4 mg daily, and metformin 850 mg twice daily to start on 12/21/2092.  We have asked that he follow up with you in the next one to two weeks, and to call with any questions or concerns before then.



Thank you for allowing us to share in the care of your patient, Mr. Yul Tanner.  If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us regarding his ongoing management.



Sincerely,

Dear Dr. Higgins,



Marion Gerald will be seeing you sometime in September for primary

care.  I was seeing her for various rheumatologic issues.  She

comes in today with ongoing pain in the left side of her face. 

Actually, upon exam, she clearly simply has left TMJ.  She has

been told this by ENT and I reinforced to her that that is what

she has and she will go ahead with a dental visit that she had

planned.  However, she has other medical problems which I will

deal with until she sees you.  At her last visit, there was a

question of PMR and she had ""25 shots"" of steroids but I have not

given her steroids and she has done reasonably well.  However,

she does have a history of a recent mild anemia but has diabetes,

hypertension and hypercholesterolemia and medications include

metformin, verapamil 250 b.i.d., Avapro 150 q.d., Pravachol 20

q.d., Bumex, Bentyl, Prilosec and Allegra.



Physical examination today reveals left TMJ pain which reproduces

her pain.  She had had no lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly.  HEENT

was otherwise unremarkable.  I obtained blood studies which

revealed a blood sugar of 208, abnormal LFTs with an AST of 62

and ALT of 58, normal ferritin B12 and folic acid, TSH of 8.8

with thyroid antibodies pending, urine microalbumin/creatinine of

14.5 and a CBC which had anemia with a hematocrit of 32.9.  A1c

pending.  A protein electrophoresis is pending and urinalysis did

not reveal proteinuria or sediment.  HBsAG and HCV are pending as

well.



I will be in touch with her regarding these results.  I was

wondering if you could see her sooner than September because of

these abnormalities outlined.  Thanks for letting me participate

in her care.



Sincerely yours,

I have interviewed and examined the patient, reviewed the

resident's documentation, and concur except as noted.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 61-year-old female who

presents complaining of chest pain and lightheadedness for the

past 4 days.  The patient has a medical history remarkable for

breast cancer, status post mastectomy and node dissection, which

have given her chronic left axillary pain.  The patient states

that this chest pain that she felt is distinct and is

nonexertional.  It is associated with increased fatigue and

shortness of breath associated with it.  Today, states that the

dyspnea resolved after being given oxygen in the ambulance en

route and called her primary care physician who told her to come

to the Emergency Department.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Remarkable for diabetes and

hypercholesterolemia.

OTHER MEDICAL HISTORY, SURGICAL HISTORY, SOCIAL HISTORY, FAMILY

HISTORY, REVIEW OF SYSTEMS, MEDICATIONS, AND ALLERGIES:  As

noted.  The patient is an active smoker.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  In the Emergency Department, the patient

is awake and alert, nontoxic appearing, afebrile, with stable

vital signs.  HEENT:  Atraumatic, normocephalic.  Oropharynx

clear, moist mucous membranes.  Neck:  Supple, without

meningismus or midline tenderness.  Respirations clear with no

rhonchi, rales, or wheezes.  Cardiovascular:  Regular rate

without murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  Abdomen:  Soft, nontender,

without rebound or guarding.  Skin is warm, well perfused without

petechiae or lesions.  There is no edema, no calf or thigh

tenderness, no CVA tenderness.  Neurologically, she is alert and

oriented x3, normal mood and affect.  No cranial nerve

abnormalities.  No sensory or motor deficits.

LABORATORY DATA:  The patient had an unremarkable CBC and

chemistry panel with flat enzymes and normal coags.  EKG was

sinus with no ectopy, interpreted as normal, chest x-ray, which

showed postoperative changes but no infiltrate or edema in this

patient with nonvertiginous lightheadedness and chest discomfort

in the context of shortness of breath and generalized malaise.

PLAN:  Plan is for admission, serial enzymes, and risk

stratification.

 ******** Not reviewed by Attending Physician ********

DISPOSITION:  The patient is admitted.

Diabetes CONSULT REPORT



CC    
Asked by Dr. Katz to see the patient for assistance with management of hyperglycemia.


HPI   
This is a 50 year old male patient with a history of type 1 diabetes diagnosed 40 years ago at an age of 10. Pt was initially treated with insulin and has been requiring insulin since diagnosis. Pt was started on an insulin pump in 2079. Current basal rates are 0.6 units from 12am-6am, 0.7 units from 6am to 6:30pm and then 0.6 units at 6:30pm again. Pt uses a carb ratio of 10:1. Pt cannot recall her correction factor as it is programmed into her pump. Monitors her blood glucoses at least 4 times per day and reports variable glucoses for 70-&gt;200. Reports hypoglycemic episodes 1-2 times per week and she is usually symptomatic with glucoses of 70. Reports that she was admitted to the hospital about one month ago with DKA. States that she had flu-like symptoms and severe vomiting and was admitted ot Ames Pathology Center for treatment. Had never had DKA before. Pt reports complications associated with diabetes. Reports retinopathy and has had several laster surgeries. Reports nephropathy as well as an episode of renal failure related to a hospitalization this summer. Reports peripheral neuropathy as well as peripheral vascular disease, including non-healing ulcers that have lead to right TMA. 


Patient is admitted for stenosis of right bypass graft stenosis and is going to the cath lab for angiogram shortly. Currently receiving D5W with 150 meq of Bicarb at 125 ccs/hr for renal protection. 
BG today (with IV fluid infusing): 230 (4am), 271 (9am), and 195 (11am - prior to leaving for cath) 
BG 12/25: 152 (1pm), 196 (6pm), 172 (8pm)
Pt is using her insulin pump. 
 
Allergies

Lab Results
12/25/2092 NA 136,  K 4.5,  CL 107,  CO2 22 (*),  BUN 52 (*),  CRE 2.11 (*),  EGFR 25,  GLU 212 (*)12/02/2092 HGBA1C 9.0 (H)12/25/2092 WBC 6.55,  RBC 4.34 (#),  HGB 10.5 (*#),  HCT 33.5 (*#),  MCV 77.2 (*#),  MCH 24.2 (*),  MCHC 31.4 (*),  PLT 302 (#) 
Assessment 
T1DM - Uncontrolled. Pt appears alert, oriented and confident to use her insulin pump in the hospital. Pt is able to verbalize her insulin doses and states that she would prefer to continue with pump use. Suspect that IV fluids are contributing to hyperglycemia, therefore reluctant to change insulin doses since IV fluids will likely stop later today. While in procedure, will need to monitor blood glucoses more closely, but anticipate that pump can continue as programmed. 


Recommendations
1. Continue with insulin pump. Instructed pt that she must:
       a. report all pre-meal bolus doses to the RN so that it can be documented on the 
       flow sheet.
       b. have blood glucoses checked as ordered using the hospital approved glucose meter. 
       c. alert RN if she feel uncomfortable using insulin pump. RN should page HO and/or diabetes dept 
       immediately for orders for SC insulin. 
       d. agree to discontinue insulin pump and start SC insulin if deemed necessary by house staff. 
Pt agrees to all of the above. 
 
2. Monitor blood glucoses at least before all meals and at bedtime. Please also check blood glucoses with any symptoms of hypoglycemia or at pt's request. Be sure to record these values on the daily flow sheet. 
 
3. For procedure today, I spoke with Kathryn Kincaid and asked that blood glucoses be monitored hourly while in cath lab unless BG is less than 140. If BG less than 140, monitor blood glucoses every 30 minutes. Treat BG less than 80 with 1/2 amp D50 and continue to monitor as described above. Do not remove insulin pump. Page 5-8112 with any concerns during the procedure. 
 
Diabetes dept will continue to monitor. Please page 5-8112 with any questions or concerns. Thank you.

CC:  falls



HPI: Mr. Oshea is a pleasant 76-year-old male with a past medical history significant for DM, HTN, h/of CVA, and glaucoma who presents after increasing number of falls at home.  Pt lives with daughter-in-law and grandchildren, who were both recently sick and recovering from influenza.  The pt began to have a non-productive cough associated with a fever (101o-102o), watery eyes, diaphoresis, and chills early this week after his family was sick.  His daughter-in-law states that he has also been increasingly confused during this time period.  He has been confusing the time of day (confusing night for daytime and vice versa), increasingly forgetful, and falling more than usual.  He has been falling with increasing frequency over the last 3 months.  On average, he would fall about once a week.  On the day prior to admission, the pt walked to Procter Gamble (2 blocks from house) and fell twice.  He was helped back up by by-standers.  He describes the fall as his legs giving out from under him, and has been shuffling his gait more than usual recently.  During each fall he denies LOC, denies CP, denies, SOB, denies incontinence, and denies head trauma.  On the day of presentation, the daughter-in-law reports that the pt fell 13 times and when she could no longer help him rise called EMS.



EW Vital signs:  T:98.6o, P:99, BP:174/65, RR:20, SaO2: 91% on RA

a.	Check orthostatic vital signs

b.	Check RPR/B12

c.	Pt needs PT evaluation, may require walker or other equipment to help him ambulate

3.	Hypovolemic Hyponatremia: Pt clinically appears hypovolemic.  A FeNa of 0.5% also suggests a hypovolemic picture.

a.	Will check Na now, and if sodium continues to improve will continue IVFs

4.	UTI: Pt has positive U/A and UC for stap (awaiting speciation and sensitivity).  Staph is an unusual cause of a UTI.  A further investigation of the cause of source of the staph is warranted.  Empiric coverage with vancomycin is also necessary given the pt's history of methicillin and levofloxacin resistant CNS.

a.	F/u UC

b.	Empiric treatment with Vancomycin 1g q12h for 7 days (CrCl > 60), await c&s for possible alternative agents

5.	Influenza A

a.	Continuous oxygen monitoring

b.	Supportive care

6.	Code Status: Discussed with patient, who expressed to me he would like to be DNR/DNI

7.	PPx

a.	Nexium

b.	Fragmin

Chief Complaint

Dyspnea and exertional chest discomfort 



History of Present Illness

Patient is a 59-year-old Chadian gentleman with multiple medical problems including DM and HTN and ESRF, recently started on hemodialysis who is admitted for right and left heart cath prior to MVR/CABG/MAZE.

Pt presented 1 year ago  with complaints of increased abd girth, lower ext edema, and worsening DOE. Cardiac ultrasound at that time revealed severe mitral regurgitation secondary to diffuse ventricular dilation and papillary muscle displacement with ejection fraction   36%.  He denied CP, PND and orthopnea at the time and adenoMibi  showed inferior  thinning which might be consistent with a prior (silent) IMI without  evidence of ongoing ischemia.   He refused further work-up or intervention until recently. He presents now for cath and surgery.

	BEAUREGARD MEMORIAL HOSPITAL	

RE:  Follow-up of coronary and peripheral arterial disease.

Dear Dr. Cooper:

  I had the pleasure of seeing Christian Mullen in the office today with Dr. Nunes. 
As you know he has an extensive coronary and peripheral arterial disease history. He last underwent intervention on his right leg vessels in December 2093. He underwent PTA/Stenting of the right external and common iliac arteries and PTA of the right common femoral/Profunda arteries. As you know, he previously has had patch endarterectomy of his left common femoral and common iliac and popliteal stenting on the left.

He previously has undergone CABG in 2082 with repeat angio in 2091 showing patent IMA to LAD graft, patent SVG-OM1 graft, and occluded grafts to OM2 and RCA. He underwent rotastenting of his native RCA with a BMS at that time.

Additionally, he has asymptomatic moderate RICA stenosis with mild LICA stenosis.


He returns today for review. He remains in reasonable health. He is still struggling to lose weight and is interested in bariatric surgery. He has limiting bilateral claudication worse since his last visit, on each side. He also has dyspnea on exertion but does not describe angina. However, it is now 3 years since his last nulcear perfusion study. He does not report any neurovascular symptoms.



	Past medical history:
   CAD 
-- 2082 CABG x 3 
-- 10/9/91 LIMA to LAD patent; mod LAD stenosis beyond graft; SVT to OM patent; SVG to RCA occl @ origin

-- 11/88 left common femoral and left popliteal artery revasc; stent Medtronic bridge Assurant ot left common iliac art 
-- 2/89 right external and internal and right common femoral artery revasc; stent to right common femoral art 
Obesity.

	Changes to Allergies
	
Fentanyl - reaction: see comment (nausea and vomiting during 11/23/2088 catheterization) [reviewed]
NKA: No Known Allergies - reaction: see comment (No known allergies to shellfish, iodine, or contrast media) [reviewed]
Penicillins - reaction: Rash [reviewed]


	Family history:
   Positive for CVD and DM.



	Social history:
   Married, glazier, 3 grown adult children 
Tob: quit 2071 smoked 3 packs of cigarettes per day for approximately 30 years 
Exercise: Negative for any regular exercise b/c of claudication 
ETOH: 1 beer a week 
Negative for illicit drug use. 


Physical examination:
	
-Pulse: 77  
-General:   No acute distress.
-Skin:   No rashes, anicteric.
-Heent:   Unremarkable
-Neck:   Carotids 2+ without bruits. JVP no jugular venous distention.
-Chest:   Clear to auscultation and percussion.
-Cardiac:   Left ventricular impulse discrete and nondisplaced. Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 and S2, with no S3 or S4. There were no murmurs, clicks or rubs.
-Abdomen:   Normal bowel sounds, soft and nontender, with no hepatosplenomegaly or masses appreciated.
-Extremities:   No cyanosis, clubbing or edema. 2+ femoral pulses with bruits. Doppler + right DP/ PT biphasic signal, doppler (+) left DP/PT monophasic signal
-BP: 130/60  Bilaterally


	EKG:
   NSR (73), normal axis, IVCD, no acute ischemic changes.


	Impression:
   Mr Mullen is a 74 year old gentleman with extensive PAD andCAD now limited again with recurrent intermittent claudication. He is now also 3 years since his last perfusion study for coronary ischemia. Finally, he warrants repeat duplex of his carotids.


	Assessment and plan:
   1. CAD- will continue current medication regimen and arrange Nuclear Adenosine MIBI stress test.

2. PAD- worsening claudication, will review angiographic images and plan for repeat catheterization to re-intervene.

3. Carotid disease; currently asymptomatic, will repeat CANIs.

I saw this patient and confirmed the history of present illness, PMH, medications, and ROS. I also confirmed the cardiovascular examination and interpreted the pertinent laboratory data.  I discussed findings with the patient and developed the management strategy.  My findings and plans are elaborated on the note above.  Issues:1) 12 years out from CABG. He is experiencing increasing DOE, which is likely due to his weight and other factors. but I am concerned that we make certain his myocardial perfusion is OK.  Will order Stress MIBI.2) PAD- claudicating L&gt;R leg...calf.  Rutherford 2.  Disabling. Has signif disease previously treated. Will review films and consider repeat CTA to decide whether he warrants relook and repeat intervention. He is s/p CFA/Profunda endarterectomy.3) Weight - will provide him names of Bariatric surgeons here at BMH.4) Carotids - asymptomatic. repeating CNI's

Mr. Xavier is a 71-year-old male coming in for the first time for 
evaluation and follow up for health maintenance.  He comes in without 
major complaints.  He is a gentleman from Eritrea who is now retired.  
He is a very active person.  He is able to walk 2-3 kilometers without any 
dyspnea on exertion, no chest pain, no shortness of breath.  He sleeps 
well.  There is no nocturia.  There is no orthopnea or PND.  There is 
currently no claudication.  He does say that he has a history of a left 
femoral/popliteal bypass done in January of 2083, one month after 
arriving from Eritrea.  This was due to chronic left lower extremity 
claudication.  Since then he has had no symptoms of claudication on both 
legs.  He does say that intermittently over the past 3-4 months he has had 
right knee pain mostly after sitting down for a long time.  No 
predominance of the AM right knee pain.  No erythema, no edema.  No 
fevers.  He has no other joint involvement.  He tells me that he has been 
told that he has low-grade diabetes that is being treated with diet, 
although on his presentation to the hospital last year he was found not be 
be diabetic.
 
His past medical history, as mentioned:
 
1.   Status post a left fempop.
2.   Status post right cataract surgery.
3.   History of diabetes.  Diet control in Eritrea.
 
Medications:  only multivitamins.
 
Smoking:  1 pack/day x 40 years.  He stopped one year ago and now smokes 
intermittently 2-3 cigarettes/day.  He has never had an alcohol abuse 
problem.  He is not a drug consumer.  
 
Physical exam:  He has an appearance that is appropriate to his age.  He 
is a very pleasant man in no acute distress.  His heart rate is 78.  His 
blood pressure is 160/80.  Respiratory rate 16.  His eyes have bilateral 
arcus, no clear-cut central cataract on the right, but on the left there 
is some opacity.  No funduscopic examination was done.  HEENT is 
unremarkable.  Neck exam is supple, nontender.  He has no bruits.  Normal 
thyroid gland.  He has no JVD.  His cardiac exam is regular rate and 
rhythm, no murmurs, no gallops, no rubs, normal S1 and S2.  His lung exam 
is clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Abdominal exam is flat, supple, 
nontender, no organomegaly, normal bowel sounds.  Extremities:  He has 
very faint trace left ankle edema where he has status post fifth digit 
amputation in the past in Eritrea.  There is no evidence of 
hypoperfusion.  There is normal color and normal temperature to the skin.  
There is crepitance upon passive motion of the right knee with no 
erythema, no edema.  His vital extremities are normal.  His pulse is 1+ on 
the right posterior tibialis and nonpalpable on the left.  His popliteals 
on the right and the left are normal.

Assessment and Plan: 
 
1.   Mild systolic hypertension.  At this time I will observe and follow 
     this blood pressure.  I will get a cholesterol level, a renal and a 
     CBC.
 
2.   History of diet-controlled diabetes.  I will obtain glycemia today.  
     He is 8 hours fasting.  
 
3.   Right knee pain.  This is likely due secondary to osteoarthritis.  I

Dear Dr. Law:

I had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Hess in followup in Cardiology today.  As you know, he is a 53-year-old gentleman who underwent implantation of a permanent pacemaker on 02/11/60 for presyncope and pauses on Holter monitoring.  His past medical history is significant for hyperlipidemia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and asthma.  Prior to his pacemaker placement, an exercise stress test was performed because of his history of exertional chest pain.  He was able to exercise for 8 minutes and 4 seconds.  The test was terminated for 7/10 substernal chest pain, but no hypotension and no overt EKG changes were noted, so we proceeded with the pacemaker implant.  Since the implant Mr. Hess describes that his intermittent symptoms of lightheadedness and shortness of breath have vanished, however, he has noticed that he is sleeping less well and occasionally has nocturnal palpitations, which potentially could represent pacing from his pacemaker.

Interrogation today of his Medtronic Kappa QQ 626 pacemaker reveals that his underlying rhythm is sinus tachycardia with intact AV conduction.  His estimated battery longevity is 89 months.  The atrial impedance is 569 ohms, the ventricular impedance is 529 ohms.  The P-wave is 5.6 mV.  The R-wave is 31.3 mV.  The threshold in the atrium is 0.75 V at 0.4 mV, and the threshold in the ventricle is 0.75 V at 0.4 msec.

In summary, Mr. Hess is doing extremely well after his pacemaker placement.  His pacemaker incision is extremely well healed.  There is no sign of erythema or hematoma.  However, his sinus tachycardia is mildly perplexing.  Looking at his heart rate histogram, it appears that this sinus rates have varied from 80-120 beats per minute for the most part aside from some low heart rate that potentially are nocturnal.  I have performed some pacing maneuvers today in clinic to attempt to determine whether the mechanism of his current tachycardia is sinus and it appears that this is sinus tachycardia.  For this reason, I have performed a TSH today, which is normal, however, I suggest to you that potentially a cursory endocrine workup and potentially a repeat echocardiogram at your facility might be indicated.  I am available to discuss these findings with you at any time.  I plan to see Mr. Hess in followup in three months' time, and if any issues arise in the interim, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Sincerely,

CXR (Today): Large heart


Assessment
: 
63 year old RH man with history of CAD s/p STEMI 2077 s/p 8 stents including LAD, systolic CHF Class Ia with EF 20% s/p BiV ICD placement, diabetes, on Coumadin and ASA, presenting with history of right arm/leg weakness since this morning.  There have been no other neurological symptoms, and no general symptoms other than some lightheadedness.  Exam is notable for decreased strength in the right upper extremity and proximal lower extremity, without facial involvement.  He has pronator drift on the right, with decreased speed and amplitude of fine finger movements on the right, and orbiting of the LUE around the RUE. He has no sensory findings, and no dysarthria or aphasia.  NIHSS was zero.  CT Brain shows loss of gray-white differentiation in Left MCA territory, with Left M1 clot.  There is reconstitution of flow in his distal MCA distribution.


The most likely mechanism is cardioembolic related to his LVAD.  He will be admitted to the Cardiac surgery service for optimal LVAD management with the Stroke consult service following.  


Plan: 


- Would agree with admitting to the Cardiac surgery service for optimal LVAD management
- Stroke consult service to follow (pager 90395)
- Head and neck imaging complete; f/u final read
- Repeat Head CT tomorrow AM or if there is any change in neurological exam
- Neuro checks q4 hours
- LVAD needs to be evaluated if possible for thrombus; will consult patient's private cardiologist
- Check baseline TCDs; will further decide whether he needs daily TCD monitoring
- To improve perfusion, maximize his SBP as possible per cardiac function; patient does not appear to be perfusion-dependent at this time
- Continue therapeutic anticoagulation for stroke prevention, currently suspecting small stroke
- Continuous telemetry and pulse oximetry
- ROMI with serial CE q 8h x3, and serial EKGs.

- Keep K&gt;4, Mg&gt;2
- Risk factor assessment: ESR, CRP, HBA1c
- Check blood cultures
- Check chromogenic Factor X level
- PT/OT evaluation
- Hold Glypizide XL: use RISS for sugar control with target blood glucose&lt;130




Thank you for this consult. Please page 90395 with any questions or concerns.

CCU Admission Note



PATIENT: Brandon Xayavong

MRN: 7826250

DATE: 7/21/83

TIME: 4:00pm

PCP: Ernest Edge, MD

ATTENDING PHYSICIAN: Ashlei Tyson, MD

CONTACT INFO: Elisha (wife) - 968-774-6381 



REASON FOR ADMISSION

Tailored therapy



HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS

Mr. Xayavong is a 62 year old man with a history of CAD (s/p STEMI and multiple stents), CHF (s/p BiV ICD, class D and stage III), DM, and CRI who was admitted for tailored therapy after a routine RHC demonstrated elevated filling pressures.



Mr. Xayavong has a primary cardiologist (Dr. Marshall) in Gloucester and has received much medical care at Oregon City Hospital.  He has been followed by Dr. Ashlei Tyson for the possibility of cardiac transplantation and has intermittently been admitted to GNC.  He was admitted to GNC from 6/13/82 to 6/19/82 after being found to be in atrial fibrillation with hypotension, fatigue, and nausea; this was 2 weeks after the placement of his BiV ICD.  He converted to sinus rhythm after amiodarone was administered, but developed a marked transaminitis.  Due to elevated filling pressures (PCWP 23), he required IV Lasix for diuresis.  He was felt to be a poor candidate for CABG given the degree of heart failure, so transplantation was instead pursued.  He was also admitted to GNC from 11/10/82 through 11/13/82 after again being found with elevated filling pressures after complaining of fatigue (PCWP 37); he received a PA line and required a Lasix drip and IV nitroprusside.  At the time of discharge, his reported dry weight was 206 lbs.



He came for a scheduled right-sided heart catheterization today as he has had increasing complaint of fatigue.  He reports that he has been feeling &#8220;lousy,&#8221; that his appetite has been &#8220;crummy,&#8221; and that he is &#8220;feeling real tired.&#8221;  He feels that these symptoms have been relatively severe but unchanged for the past 2 years.  He denies overt shortness of breath, but essentially fatigues very easily with physical exertion, and has been requiring multiple naps a day.  He states that he has been careful with his diet (both fluid and salt intake) without any changes, and that he has been entirely compliant with his medications.  Of note, his cardiologist attempted to change him from Toprol XL to Coreg several months ago, and that seems to have made him feel worse.  He continues to urinate to his home Lasix dosing.  He denies any sensation of chest pain or chest pressure, and denies chest palpitations or sensation of fluttering; he states clearly that he could tell when his heart was in an abnormal rhythm in 6/72.  He says that his pacemaker was &#8220;checked&#8221; last week and that he was told he didn&#8217;t have any &#8220;episodes.&#8221;  He believes that he has been putting on weight recently, and reports that his baseline weight is ~225 lbs.  He denies recent fevers or chills.  He has no complaint of leg swelling.

Olney, OH  23751



Dear Dr. Gordon:



I had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Hess in followup in Cardiology today.  As you know, he is a 54-year-old gentleman who underwent implantation of a permanent pacemaker on 02/11/2060 for his presyncope and pauses on Holter monitoring.



His past medical history is significant for hyperlipidemia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and asthma.  Prior to his pacemaker placement, an exercise stress test was performed because of a history of exertional chest pain.  He was able to exercise for 8 minutes and 4 seconds.  The test was terminated for 7/10 substernal chest pain, but no hypotension or overt ECG changes were noted.  We proceeded to pacemaker implant and Mr. Hess has done well since that time.  He remarks that his intermittent symptoms of lightheadedness have resolved.  However, he occasionally still has nocturnal palpitations as well as occasional exertional chest discomfort.  He tells me that he underwent testing at Wheatland Memorial consisting of a stress test with MIBI imaging that perhaps showed an abnormality, though the report of this test is not available to me today for review.



Interrogation today of his Medtronic Kappa CTE 226 pacemaker reveals that his underlying rhythm is sinus tachycardia with intact AV conduction.  The estimated longevity on the battery life is 95 months.  The atrial impedance is 544 ohms and the ventricular impedance is 519 ohms.  The P-wave in the atrium is 5.6 mV and the R-wave in the ventricle is 31 mV.  The threshold in the atrium is stable at 0.5 V at 0.4 msec, and the threshold in the ventricle is also stable at 0.5 V at 0.4 msec.



In summary, the pacemaker appears to be working quite well.  However, Mr. Hess persists in a perplexing sinus tachycardia that has been present since his last pacemaker interrogation.  I have therefore ordered an echocardiogram to rule out any ill effects of the sinus tachycardia or any structural heart disease that may be causing the sinus tachycardia.  In addition, I have performed a 12-lead ECG, which appears to show sinus mechanism rather than an atrial tachycardia.  Today in the office, his sinus rate is 109 beats per minute with stable blood pressure.  Mr. Hess and I have checked thyroid studies in the recent past and those have been unremarkable.  



I have discussed this case with Dr. Quatrell Swanson who has agreed to assist in Cardiology care for Mr. Hess in the near future, since Dr. Law is moving his practice to the NCHC.  I plan to see Mr. Hess in followup in three months' time for his pacemaker.  If any issues arise in the interim, please do not hesitate to contact me.



Sincerely,

Patient Name: FLAHERTY, XAVIER;  MRN: 1935081
Dictated on: 10/23/2120 by ROSITA KO, M.D. 

 
The patient is a 72-year-old male, paraplegic, referred for evaluation of recurrent bladder infections.  The patient has persistent presence of bacteria in his urine and there is a concern that he might have a persistent source of infection.  The patient denies fevers, chills, sweats, decrease in energy, loss of appetite, pain in the lower abdomen or penile discharge.  He reports there is some soreness around the meatus, which he attributes to self-catheterizing he is required to do 3 times a day.  He is well educated in terms of cleaning around the side and the appropriate way to do self-catheterization.   
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Diabetes, hypertension, paraplegia secondary to unclear disk problems in 2107, right hip ulcer with trochanteric osteomyelitis in December 2118, treated with Unasyn x6 weeks and debridement and surgical flap, sacral decubiti in 2119 treated with Unasyn x6 weeks, local debridement healing by secondary intention.  No history of kidney stones.   
SOCIAL:  Ex-tobacco use 2-3 packs per day, quit 25 years. Alcohol prior heavy use, quit 25 years.  Lives alone.  Prior work included Heavy-Duty Equipment Mechanic, Ironworker, as well as Electric Appliance Servicer.  
 
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.  
 
MEDICATIONS:  Blood pressure medication, name unknown. Metformin.  Note, patient had been on Bactrim prophylaxis over the spring.   
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Blood pressure 150/100, heart rate 100, temperature 97.9.  In general, vigorous, well-appearing man in wheelchair.  Awake and alert.  HEENT, sclerae anicteric.  Conjunctivae noninjected.  Neck supple.  No significant lymphadenopathy.  Chest, clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Cardiac, regular rate and rhythm.  No murmurs.  Abdomen benign.  Extremities, warm and well perfused.  No edema.  
 
IMPRESSION:  Presence of bacteria in static urine within the bladder is not necessarily diagnostic as infection given patient's lack of symptoms and likely reflects colonization.   
PLAN:  Would not treat patient with antibiotics unless he develops signs or symptoms of infection such as fevers, chills, sweats, elevated white blood cell count, pain in the suprapubic area or decreased energy.

CCU JAR Admission Note



Name: Urban, Russell

MRN:  4722064

Date of Admission:  7/09/93

PCP:   Georgia

Cards: ward



ID:  50 y/o man transferred to CCU for wide complex tachyarrhythmia 



HPI:  50 y/o man with no PMH and cardiac risk factors of smoking and family history (father died of MI at age 41) who presented to the ED with chest pain. He had an ETT per patient report in Georgia which was neg for ischemia 4 years ago.  He claims excellent exercise tolerance can run at least 3 miles without SOB or CP but does not exercise regularly.   At concert on day of admission, he was sitting at rest when he had sudden onset of crushing sub-sternal chest pain, 8/10, no radiation, associated with mild SOB and marked diaphoresis.  Pt reported some associated back pain with onset, like ""I was being crushed like a sandwich.""  Was not eating at time, not like heartburn, no fevers, chills, cough, or chest trauma.  EMT was called-2 SL ntg relieved pain, was given ASA. 



On arrival to the ED, he was chest pain free.  His HR was 52-60 in normal sinus rhythm.  On hindsight, EKG showed sinus bradycardia with 1mm STE in III,    mm aVF, 1mm STD in I, ? aVL with biphasic T in I, TWI in aVL.  He received ASA and SLTNG

Cardiac RF include tobacco (1/2 ppd x 30 yrs) and early family hx (Dad died of MI, first MI at 41).  No known HTN, DM, or hyperlipidemia.  



Course on floor:



Seen for initial H&P when patient came to CCU5.  During exam, patient became acutely diaphoretic, appeared uncomfortable, still complaining of CP with some mild back pain.  

BP:  L arm 105/66, R arm 90/63. (2 rpt BPs were equal on both arms within 5 mm Hg) HR bradycardia in high 40s, sat 98% 2L.  Tele demonstrated sinus brady, then several runs of 40-50bt wide QRS tachyarrythmia which spontaneously resolved back to sinus bradycardia. Pt was symptomatic during these episodes and appeared acutely SOB, diaphoretic.  Nursing supervisor and medical senior stat paged, 12 ld EKG repeated, pt was given 2 mg IV magnesium and 100mg of lidocaine, started on nonbreather. Heparin was ordered and pt was transferred to the CCU.  



On arrival to CCU, pt was lethargic and diaphoretic.  He denied chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea.



SDU Course:

For ventricular ectopy (likely AIVR in setting of ischemia), pt was transitioned to Amiodarone.  This was tapered off and he had no further ectopy.

 

Echo was performed 7/10:

MITRAL VALVE

There is no evidence of mitral valve prolapse.  There is trace mitral

regurgitation by color and spectral Doppler.



LEFT ATRIUM

There is no evidence of left atrial dilatation.



AORTIC VALVE, AORTA, LVOT

There is no evidence of valvular aortic stenosis.  The aortic valve is

tricuspid.  There is no evidence of aortic insufficiency by color or spectral

Doppler.



LEFT VENTRICLE

The left ventricular cavity size is normal.  The left ventricular systolic

function is impaired.  The left ventricle is diffusely hypokinetic with

regional variation. The Inferior wall is akinetic.  The estimated ejection

fraction is 28 %.



TRICUSPID VALVE - IVC, SVC

There is color and spectral Doppler evidence of trace tricuspid insufficiency.



RIGHT VENTRICLE

The right ventricle is not dilated.  The right ventricle is diffusely

hypokinetic.



PERICARDIAL DISEASE AND EXTRACARDIAC MASSES

There is no evidence of pericardial effusion.



Pt was taken to the cath lab 7/11 where his RHC showed RA 9, PA 25/15/20, PCWP 13, CO 6.4.  Mild LAD disease, 30% circumflex stenosis, RCA 100% occlusion, stented x3 with dissection of RCA during procedure.  He also had transient reocclusion during procedure.  TIMI II flow after IC adenosine.  IABP and temp wire (for profound bradycardia) were placed during procedure.  V-gram showed basal inferior AK and anterolateral HK, EF approximately 40%.  His peak CK were 1491.

Because his initial echo showed low EF out of proportion to his ischemic event, other causes of low EF were investigated.  His serum Fe was slightly low, TSH was normal, SPEP had several low Igs but no evidence of myeloma.   Lipid profile showed Cholesterol 210, Trig 59, HDL 45, LDL 153.  HgbA1c was 6.3.  Because of reocclusion during cath, hypercoag workup was sent and was negative (including lupus anticoagulant, hypercoag panel, HIT).

He continued to have some chest pain post-cath with mild increase of CK likely d/t distal embolization.  He has now been persistently pain-free.  His IABP was d/ced 7/12.  He was continued on ASA, Plavix, Lipitor and Bblocker, Captopril were added and can be titrated up.

Critically ill secondary to: 
R. BG/thalamus hemorrhage with IVH extension, with potential for fatal neurologic deterioration

Critical Care Min: 35 min




History: Ms. Olivo is a 75-year-old RHW with DM, HTN and dementia, LSW at 11:00 a.m., then found by son at 1:45 pm to be less responsive with left-sided weakness. BP was 200/96 when EMS arrived. Here her SBP was in the 220s with heart rate in the 50-60s.  Her initial exam revealed somnolence, but able to follow some very simple commands like squeezing hand, nodding head; she had right gaze deviation, left hemianopsia, left facial palsy, left arm 
and leg plegia, right arm and leg paresis, and dysarthria.  She received 10 mg of hydralazine for her SBP greater than 220.  CT revealed a right basal ganglia/thalamic hemorrhage with intraventricular extension including casting of the 4th ventricle, 7 mm mls to the left, contrast extravasation suggestive of active hemorrhage but no evidence of any vascular abnormality.  She was intubated for worsening mental status and had an a-line placed for Bp monitoring and management. 



At baseline, Ms. Olivo is wheelchair-bound, according to her daughter, due to her neuropathy.  She is dependent for all of her ADLs and has a home health aide.

UE slight w/d to deep noxious stim, plegic in LUE., w/d briskly in the L. LE vs. RLE, toes up b/l




Imaging/Studies/TCD: 

Head CT/A (6/29):  Prelim read shows a right basal ganglia/thalamic hemorrhage (1.87 cm x 4.5 cm in largest dimension) with intraventricular extension including casting of the 4th ventricle, and mls of 7 mm to the left.  CTA showed at least 3 spot signs indicating active hemorrhage but no evidence of any vascular abnormality.





Assessment: 
Olivo is a 75-year-old right-handed woman with diabetes mellitus, HTN and dementia, and found with a ~ 11 cc R. BG/thalamic bleed with pan-ventricular extension with casted 3rd and 4th ventricles, and mild midline shift. The etiology appears to be hypertensive in nature; CTA was negative for a vascular anomaly. A mass lesion cannot be excluded at this time however, and will need an MRI. Her prognosis is somewhat difficult to articulate at this time using the conventional FUNC  (8) and ICH (2) scores given her clinical status and medical  comorbidities.

WAGNER,LONNIE   097-87-37-2                  VISIT DATE: 11/03/65

The resident's history, physical examination and evaluation were

him.  Please see the resident's note for the remainder of the 

details of the patient's history.  Please see the note for further 

details.  

HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  This is a 72-year-old male with a 

history of myeloproliferative disorder who is followed by 

hematology/oncology after diagnosis in July of 2065.  He now 

presents with several episodes of bleeding.  He has been having 

epistaxis for approximately one month.  He had one episode of 

hematemesis this morning with red blood with clots.  He has also 

noted some red blood around his stool when he moves his bowels over 

the last two days.  His bowel movements have not been black but 

there has been red blood that fills the toilet water.  He denies 

any light-headedness although his wife states that he has been 

complaining of feeling dizzy at home.  He denies any headache or 

visual change, denies any shortness of breath or chest pain.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

60 year old woman presents with a history of watery diarrhea, gas and diffuse abdominal pain for the past two weeks that has increased in intensity in the last 3 days.  For the month prior to the onset of diarrhea she reports that she had been constipated.  No fevers or chills; patient is afebrile and the WBC is not elevated.  Her abdominal exam is remarkable for obesity, tympany and mild LLQ tenderness.  Finding of air in the gastroepiploic and portal vessels with no associated intraabdominal pathology is of uncertain significance.  Fibroids, which have been previously diagnosed, are seen.  Normal colonoscopy 08/20/2076.



1) GI:  Constipation for a month followed by diarrhea for two weeks.  This history is suggestive of overflow diarrhea.  Patient denies recent narcotic usage and no obstructing lesions are seen on CT scan.  May also be infection, malabsorption, osmotic, inflammatory, secretory or a motility defect.  No evidence is seen for ischemia, inflammation or infection.  Bowel dysmotility resulting from DM may play a role in a motility disorder.

 - Diet: clears now, NPO after midnight

 - Stool for fecal leukocytes, O&P, C. diff

 - Bowel regimen:  colace, senokot, miralax

 - Reglan PRN nausea

- Follow clinical exam

 - Follow WBC, T, lactate for signs of acute sepsis or ischemia

 - Appreciate GI input (Dr. Utterback)

 - Apprecate surgery input (Dr. Espinosa)

 - Ranitidine prophylaxis, zofran PRN nausea



2) Gyn:  Patient is s/p breast cancer and has fibroids.  No evidence of abdominal mass other than fibroids.

 - Continue on tamoxifen 20 mg PO QAM



3) Psychiatric:  Depression & anxiety

 - Buspar

 - clonazepam

 - effexor



4) DM2:  Continue home meds (metformin + insulin), hold when on diet without substantial calories (clears, NPO)



5) Prophylaxis:  patient is ambulatory; ranitidine; commode by bedside.

Reason for Visit	

Comprehensive physical exam and ongoing management of multiple medical problems.



Problems	  

Congestive heart failure	      

He had admission to MCH 9/87 with CHF.  He was started on Carvedilol and Spironolactone during that visit.  He was aggressively diuresed with marked improvement in his symptoms.  Beta blocker was reduced during that admission as well.  Most recent echo from 5/02/88 showed severely depressed LV systolic function, EF 30%, global hypokinesis with antero-apical akinesis.  Moderate LV margin.  Mild concentric LVH and mild L atrial enlargement (41 mm.).  Dilated aortic loop.  Normal RV size and function.  Mild aortic insufficiency and trace MR.



He is now doing exceedingly well on his current regimen and denies any symptoms of SOB, orthopnea or pedal edema.  He continues to be followed regularly by regularly by Dr. Cook for his ischemic cardiomyopathy/CHF.

coronary artery disease	      

After his admission for CHF, he underwent dolbutamine stress test on 9/30/87, which revealed a small area of ischemia in mid-anterior and a moderate to large-sized area of ischemia inferiorly and there was moderate LV dilatation following stress.  Based on this, he was admitted to MCH and underwent cardiac catheterization.  10/87 he underwent stenting X4 of L circumflex coronary artery and third obtuse marginal branch.  Notably, his cath also revealed a dominant RCA which was occluded proximately and was collateralized from the LAD, which was supplied by the L internal mammary artery.  The L main had no significant lesions.  The LAD had a 50% lesion just before the first diagonal and the mid-LAD was occluded.



He had successful stenting with very good angiographic results and he received adjuvant intravenous [        ] therapy.  He was discharged the following day without complications.  Although his current activity level is somewhat limited by his DJD (see below), he is exercising regularly in the pool and he currently denies any symptoms of angina.

pacemaker	      

S/P DDD pacemaker for sick sinus syndrome 7/83 and doing well.  Continues follow-up with Dr. Whitlock/Cook.

S/P CARDIAC ARREST	      

12/76.  10/76 DEVELOPED EXERTIONAL ANGINA, POSITIVE ETT. CATH AT NEDH REVEALED THREE-VESSEL CAD. AWAITING CABG WHEN 12/76 SUFFERED CARDIAC ARREST. FOUND TO BE IN VT, HAD RECURRENT VT. TRANSFERRED TO MCH AND UNDERWENT CABG AND AICD 2/77.  [04-Nov-2078]



He is doing well S/P ICD implantation in 2/77 with revisions in 7/80 and in 2084.  

hypertension	      

BP is slightly high today, but we will recheck at next visit.  If it remains elevated, would consider increasing Carvedilol

diabetes mellitus	      

He continues on Glyburide and although he checks fasting sugars infrequently, they are typically in the 120's and he denies any symptoms of hypoglycemia.  He has not seen a podiatrist regularly and I have encouraged him to begin this process.  Will check FBS, HBA1C and urine for microalbumin today.

hypercholesterolemia	      

He has had virtual normalization of his lipid profile with Lipitor.  We will check fasting lipids and LFT's today.

nephropathy	      

S/P renal biopsy 10/79 for severe proteinuria which was consistent with diabetic nephropathy. As noted above, a 24-hour urine recently revealed 6gm of protein.  He is on new maximal doses of ACEI's.  [02-Jun-2087]



Recheck BUN and creatinine today.

peripheral vascular disease	      

He has bilateral femoral bruits and diminished peripheral pulses, but because of his limited walking ability, currently has no symptoms of claudication.

RECTAL FISTULA	      

SINCE LAST VISIT HE WAS SEEN BY DR. JENSON AND UNDERWENT A FLEXIBLE. SIG. HE HAD A SINUS OPENING IN THE LEFT POSTERIOR PERIANAL AREA. HE FELT THAT TO FULLY EVALUATE THIS TO SEE WHETHER IT WAS AN ANAL FISTULA OR A PILONIDAL CYST THAT EXAM UNDER ANESTHESIA WITH UNROOFING OF THE LESION WAS INDICATED.  PT SO FAR HAS DECLINED THIS, BUT WILL LET DR. JENSON KNOW IF HE RECONSIDERS.  CURRENTLY HE IS WILLING TO LIVE WITH HIS SYMPTOMS.

OSTEOARTHRITIS	      

He has had recent significant worsening in his L knee pain.  It has now gotten to the point where it limits his ability to walk, so that he can only ""limp less than a block"" and has difficulty with stairs.  Given that he has done well from a cardiac standpoint since his admissions in the spring, he is interested in pursuing a L TKR replacement if Cardiology feels it would be feasible.  Will refer him to Dr. Robles for initial evaluation.

Carotid stenosis	      

According to Dr. Cook's records, a carotid artery duplex scan from 5/06 showed 60 to 80% stenosis of the RICA, but I do not find those records of PCIS.  Apparently he is scheduled for a repeat study before he follows up with Dr. Cook.  He is S/P R cerebellar CVA back in '80 and has had stable minor neurologic deficits since that time and currently denies any new neurologic symptoms.



Review of Systems	

Small lesion on his R ear.  Recent R groin infection which required treatment with antiobiotics by Dr. Valentine in 5/06.  Nocturia X1.  Denies symptoms of hypoglycemia.  No neurologic symptoms.  Denies palpitations, SOB, chest pain, lightheadedness or syncope.  Denies peripheral edema.  No abdominal pain or change in his bowels.  He does have chronic rectal fistula and continues to have intermittent hematochezia and discharge, but he is able to self-treat this and declines surgery.  No melena.

SECTIONS OF THIS NOTE WERE CREATED WITH A 'COPY AND PASTE' ACTION.  THESE SECTIONS MAY NOT HAVE COPIED COMPLETELY.  PLEASE USE CAUTION WHEN RENDERING CLINICAL JUDGMENT BASED ON THE INFORMATION IN THIS NOTE.GCC Team A Infectious Disease Consultation


Patient: Mack, Rose C (06129040, 63I)
ID Fellow: Amanda Qualls
ID Attending: Craig Faulkner
Referring Physician: Dr. Kevin Katz
Date of Consult: 10/26/2092


Reason for Consult: DM, chronic R and L. foot ulcerations; L. foot ulceration with surrounding erythema, pain


HPI: 50F w/longstanding type I DM with retinopathy, nephropathy, autonomic and peripheral neuropathy, recent development of L. heel and forefoot ulcers, here with a few days of pain, erythema, and swelling around her L. forefoot ulcer. She has an extremely complicated history of R and now L. foot infections and ulcerations, in setting of here severe neuropathy and DM. She originally sustained a R. 5th metatarsal fracture in 2083, with poor union, and subsequent fracture of her 2nd &#8211; 4th metatarsals. She developed a chronic ulcerated callus over her R. lateral metatarsal heads, with underlying osteomyelitis&#8212;this did not improve despite multiple courses of antibiotics. She underwent I+D of her R. foot ulceration in 12/89, OR cultures grew P. aeruginosa. In 3/90, she underwent debridement of her chronic R. lateral plantar ulceration and skin grafting. In 6/90, she underwent deep debridement of her ongoing 5th metatarsal osteomyelitis, along with excision of her 5th metatarsal&#8212;bone cultures grew MSSA. She did well until 2/92, when she underwent R. ankle revision for an equinovarus deformity of her R. hindfoot (calcaneal osteotomy, lateral translation, dorsiflexion first metatarsal osteotomy, and Achilles lengthening). She subsequently developed a R. heel ulceration, and in 4/92, underwent debridement of this ulceration, removal of a screw, and placement of a vacuum sponge. Her wound continued to heal poorly, and she underwent R. SFA to posterior tibial bypass grafting. In 7/92, she underwent debridement of her R. heel wound and placement of a full thickness skin graft, which has taken well; she feels that her R. heel has been healing nicely. During her long hospitalization in 4/92, she started developing L. heel and L. forefoot ulcerations. She attributes the heel ulcerations to chronic pressure from her position in bed, and the forefoot ulcerations to the boots that were used to relieve her heel pressure, which apparently abraded her forefoot chronically. These ulcerations continued to worsen over the next few months, and she presented with cellulitis of this area in 8/92. She received vancomycin, levofloxacin, flagyl initially, then augmentin, with persistent poor healing of her wounds. On 9/10, she underwent operative debridement of her L. plantar heel ulcer&#8212;she was found to have extensive necrotic yellow-brown tissue underlying her L. heel eschar, which was extensively debrided; she received a course of linezolid postoperatively. She had an angiogram on 9/12, which showed no significant flow limiting lesions in her LLE, and good flow through her prior R. SFA to posterior tibial bypas graft. She feels that her wounds have been healing fairly well recently; she feels that her R. heel is almost completely healed, and that her L. heel ulcer is smaller than it was previously. Her L. forefoot ulcer is also more shallow than it was in the past. Over the past 2-3 days, she developed fairly acute swelling, erythema, and pain around her forefoot ulcer, with erythema spreading to the dorsal surface of her foot. She was seen in vascular surgery clinic, and was admitted for antibiotics and further debridement. She has a chronic &#8216;fast heartbeat,&#8217; denies any systemic symptoms (no fevers, chills, sweats, notable weight changes), headaches, sinus symptoms, sore throat, cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, blood in her bowel movements, dysuria, frequency, LE edema, rashes, myalgias, or new arthralgias. She feels that her foot erythema has improved significantly overnight with vancomycin.

Impression/Recommendations: 50F w/longstanding type I DM with severe peripheral neuropathy, recent development of L. heel and forefoot ulcers, here with cellulitis surrounding her L. forefoot ulcer, improving on vancomycin. Awaiting debridement today, need to determine depth of her infection and whether it extends to bone:


&#183;         Continue vancomycin 1g IV bid for now. Her renal function is impaired from her DM&#8212;would check a vancomycin trough prior to her next dose.
&#183;         Please send biopsy of bone underlying her L. forefoot ulcer for gram stain, aerobic culture, and anaerobic culture from OR today.
&#183;         Needs to be on MRSA contact precautions&#8212;grew abundant MRSA from her R. groin wound last month.
&#183;         Has missed her follow-up mammogram appointments and colonoscopy appointments for follow-up of an abnormal lumpectomy finding and a &#8216;precancerous polyp&#8217; because of her recent foot issues. Unable to stand for mammography because of her foot issues&#8212;will discuss optimal imaging of her L. breast with breast radiology, will hopefully be able to obtain this study during this hospitalization.


Discussed with Dr. Craig Faulkner, ID Attending. Recommendations discussed with Dr. Zane Querry of primary team. Thank you for this interesting consult&#8212;we will continue to follow with you.

(449) 515-0294





REASON FOR VISIT:  Follow up cholesterol and new problem of chest

pain.



HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. Gerald is a 61-year-old patient

with history of diabetes, hypertension, elevated lipids,

hypothyroidism and I now have available old records from previous

doctor, Yesenia Olive.  The following issues addressed:

1.  Diabetes:  She is currently feeling well and denies any

symptoms of polyuria and polydipsia.  Maintained on Glucophage

1000 mg b.i.d.  Blood sugar testing at home once or twice a day

is around 120.  We will be obtaining glycohemoglobin level today.

 Has ophthalmological exam scheduled.

2.  Elevated cholesterol:  With her diabetes, her target LDL will

be less than a 100.  She is maintained on Pravachol 40 mg a day

and LDL from 09/15/83 was 154 with a total cholesterol of 256. 

We will initiate Zetia to add to the Pravachol.

3.  Hypothyroidism:  Maintained on Levoxyl and TSH level is

acceptable at 3.93 with a T4 of 8.5.

4.  Hypertension:  Maintained on Avapro and verapamil and blood

pressure is currently acceptable.

5.  Question of rheumatological disease, elevated sedimentation

rate, diagnosis of polymyalgia rheumatica has been considered in

the past.  No new symptoms of muscle aches, but now report a

history of recent chest pain.

6.  Exercise-induced chest pain.  The patient has noted over the

past month that she gets a pressure sensation in her mid chest

when she is walking after about 20 minutes of exertion.  This

subsides when she stops and rests for a while.  This has been

reproduced for the last three times she has taken a walk with her

husband.  Review of records from Dr. Olive show that she had

thallium stress test 12/26/79 achieving 85% of maximum predicted

heart rate with a workload of 10.1 minutes.  EKG showed 1 mm ST

depression in leads II and V4 through 6.  The thallium scan

showed slight apical ischemia and mild ischemia in the anterior

walls suggesting minimal ischemia in the left anterior descending

artery distribution.  She does not recall having symptoms at that

time.  Denies palpitations, sweats or shortness of breath with

chest discomfort.  There are some radiation into both shoulders

and neck.  Multiple cardiac risk factors include elevated lipids,

diabetes, hypertension and postmenopausal.



CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Levoxyl 50 mcg q.d., Pravachol 40 mg h.s.,

Prilosec 20 mg q.d., Flexeril 10 mg q.d., Bumex 2 mg q.d., Avapro

150 mg q.d., Verapamil of 240 mg b.i.d. and Glucophage 500 mg two

tabs b.i.d.



DRUG ALLERGIES:  None.



SOCIAL HISTORY:  director/midwife for Iowa Clinic in Temescal Valley.



REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Denies abdominal pain, change in bowel

habits, fevers, sweats chills, weight loss; otherwise, as above.



PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She appears in no distress.  Temperature

of 97.8 degrees, BP 130/70 and pulse is 70.  Pupils are equal,

round and reactive.  Conjunctivae clear. Sclerae anicteric. 

Oropharynx benign.  Neck is supple.  No neck vein distention. 

Thyroid is not palpable.  Chest is clear to percussion and

auscultation.  Heart:  Regular rhythm, S1, S2 and no murmur, rub,

thrill or gallop.  Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, active bowel sounds

and no organomegaly.  Extremities:  No clubbing, cyanosis or

edema.  Neurophysiologic:  EKG shows normal sinus rhythm.  No

abnormal complex.



IMPRESSION AND PLAN:

1.  Diabetes.  We will check her glycohemoglobin and assure she

has had an ophthalmologic follow up.  Maintain Glucophage.

2.  Elevated cholesterol.  Add Zetia 10 mg q.d.

3.  Chest pain.  Symptoms certainly suggest ischemia.  I have

contacted Dr. Ng in Cardiology and he is arranging for an

ETT MIBI and a cardiology consult.  I prescribed nitroglycerin

1/150 to use sublingual q.5minutes. x 3 for chest

discomfort and she will limit exercise until ETT is accomplished.

 Suspect she might need catheterization and hesitant to add

beta-blocker because of high-dose verapamil and risk of inducing

heart block.

4.  Hypothyroidism:  Adequate replacement dose on current

Levoxyl.  The patient will see me back in four weeks' time and

cardiac workup to be arranged for early next week.

S:   Here for follow up of his colonic polyps.  He wants to know the results from

     them.  He is not taking hydrochlorothiazide and is curious about his blood

     pressure.  He said he has cut his alcohol back to 6 pack once a week.  He

     has cut back his cigarettes to one time per week.  He does say he has had

     some problems with his memory recently, although no other manifestations

     of dementia and no difficulty with ADLs.  He says he uses Viagra

     occasionally and it works for him.

                      OFFICE NOTE
  Rickey George
  MR#1131414
  October 05, 2092
  
  Reason for visit: scheduled follow up status post MCH hospitalization.  
  
  PROBLEMS:
  
  PVD: since last visit he was admitted to MCH with gangrene in his left second toe. 
  Admitted MCH 8/29 through 9/9/92.  Treated by Dr. Randall.  Underwent extensive
  revascularization including right common and external artery transluminal balloon
  angioplasty and stenting, bilateral common and profunda femoral artery
  endarterectomies, right and left femoral to femoral bypass graft, left femoral to above
  knee popliteal bypass graft.  With this surgery, only his left second toe remained
  gangrenous and he was able to avoid BKA.  
  
  He will likely either auto-amputate or will require amputation of his left second toe
  which remains gangrenous but he has reasonable perfusion to the remainder of his left
  foot and has follow up scheduled next week with Dr. Randall.  
  
  Renal insufficiency: during his hospitalization he bumped his creatinine quite a bit but
  this appeared to be due to acute interstitial nephritis caused by Unasyn (positive urine
  EO's), reached a high of 3.9 on 9/02 but was down to 1.4 which is baseline at the time of
  hospital discharge 9/9.  Will recheck renal function today.  
  
  Diabetes mellitus: his appetite has been poor and he had blood sugars, which were low on
  oral agents, and these have been discontinued.  His blood sugars are now in the normal
  range on no oral agents or insulin.  Will need to monitor closely through rehab.  
  
  CHF: he had been on 80 b.i.d. of Lasix prior to his hospitalization.  At the time of
  hospital discharge his dose was down to 40 b.i.d. and not surprisingly he developed quite
  a bit of recurrent peripheral edema.  He called the office and I increased his Lasix back
  up to 60 b.i.d. but he still has significant edema.  Will go back to 80 b.i.d. with close
  monitoring.  
  
  Hypertension: with diuresis and weight loss, his BP is running low.  Will hold lisinopril
  for now.  Close VNA follow up.  
  
  COPD: doing well despite recent surgery.  Continues to use Combivent inhaler p.r.n.  
  
  Anemia: Crit was in the 20's during his hospitalization in the setting of acute renal failure
  and surgery with blood loss.  His Crit at the time of discharge was approximately 28.7
  and he was being started on Epogen.  Unfortunately because of insurance issues, he has
  not actually been able to yet obtain it but the plan is for him to get 2,000 units 3 times a

  week.  For now, he is on vitamins and iron supplements as his bowels tolerate.  Given his
  history of CAD, goal is to keep his hematocrit between 30-32.  
  
  Coronary artery disease: despite his recent surgical stress and anemia, he has had no
  anginal symptoms.  
  
  Review of systems: constipation related to the iron.  Generally weak.  Home services
  now include VNA, home health aide, PTOT, walking with a walker, biggest issue is
  mostly depression in the setting of his failing health.  
  
  Social history: wife very involved with his care.  
  
  Physical exam: BP 98/60.  Pulse 64.  Lungs clear to A & P.  Cor: SEMACIAN gallop. 
  No rub.  Abdomen: mildly distended, nontender.  Multiple well healed surgical scars. 
  Extremities: incisions in the groin.  No erythema.  Right groin several cm question cystic
  structure beneath the incision.  Soft, nontender, non-erythematous.  2-3+ edema in the
  extremities bilaterally.  Dry gangrene left second toe.  
  
  Disposition: 1. Increase Lasix to 80 b.i.d. phone follow up within several days.  
  2. Temporarily hold lisinopril given low BP.  
  3. Continue Percocet for toe pain.  
  4. Follow up with Dr. Randall who needs to assess the cystic mass in his right groin.  
  5. Will continue to work with insurance to try to obtain Epogen.  In the meantime, will
  transfuse if Crit drops below 28.  
  6. Add Lexapro 10mg 1 p.o. q.d. 
  
  Addendum: long discussion with the patient and his wife (his healthcare proxy) today
  about end of life issues.  Specifically he states he would never consider any amputation
  other than his single toe at this point.  He would specifically ""rather die"" than undergo a
  BKA.  He also states he wishes to be DNR and would not consider intubation even under
  the circumstances of acute CHF or pneumonia.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 51-year-old woman who returns after recent acute coronary syndrome experience and for follow up of other medical problems.


PROBLEMS:
1.  Acute coronary syndrome.  She was in New York and experienced chest pain.  She was seen at Conway Hospital where she underwent placement of two stents in the right coronary artery.  EKG changes suggest IMI.  She was told that she would need further intervention, but comes with no paperwork.  She has had no further chest pain.
2.  Diabetes mellitus.  A1c one month ago was 6.7.
3.  Hyperlipidemia.  Please see prior notes for full lipid analysis, but LDL was 221.  She has been on Zocor.
4.  Mitral valve disease.  Prior to recent coronary event, she underwent an echocardiogram which demonstrated a mildly thickened and calcific aortic valve with a slight gradient.  There is calcification of the posterior mitral annulus and leaflet as well as the subvalvular apparatus with an echo dense mobile structure and trigger aspect suggesting a partially disrupted chordae.


MEDICATIONS:  
1.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. daily.
2.  Plavix 75 mg p.o. daily.
3.  Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg daily.
4.  Zocor 20 mg p.o. nightly though given a prescription for Lipitor 80 mg nightly in New York.
5.  Lisinopril 20 mg p.o. daily.
6.  Metformin 500 mg daily.
7.  Norvasc 10 mg daily.
8.  Nitroglycerin 0.4 mg p.r.n.


REVIEW OF SYMPTOMS:  No significant weight change, febrile signs or symptoms, headache, blurred vision, tinnitus, cough, shortness of breath, nausea, abdominal pain, nightsweats, diarrhea, dysuria, polyuria, skin rash, bruising, joint pain, or focal weakness.


PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient is in no acute distress.  Blood pressure 120/88, weight 213 pounds, and temperature 97.8.  Chest clear to percussion and auscultation. Cardiac exam; no extra sounds. Rather coarse near holosystolic murmur. No apprecialble 2nd or third compenents. No pedal edema.


EKG today:  Heart rate was 54 and regular with normal intervals.  She has a Q-wave in III and F and slight reversal of R-wave progression in right precordium.  These are distinct change from EKG done one month ago.


ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
1.  Status post IMI.  Not on beta-blocker and I will not initiate given sinus bradycardia.  I have arranged for her to be seen in Cardiology to determine best next steps.  I tried to contact the cardiologist who took care of her in Conway Hospital whose phone number is 674-449-3338.
2.  Diabetes mellitus.  Good control.
3.  Hyperlipidemia.  Will initiate therapy with Lipitor 80 mg p.o. nightly for this and problem 1 above.  Prior authorization form completed.
4.  Mitral valve disease.

	CARDIOLOGY

	

	SAINT VINCENT HOSPITAL

	



	Interval History:

   Since last seen, Ursula notes that her weight continues to rise, and with this, her angina is clearly worse.  She has stable symptoms, nothing to suggest an ACS, but she's dyspneic with exertion and takes nitro occasionally.



Medications:  Atenolol 100 mg qd, Aspirin 81 mg. qd, Imdur 30 mg., Lipitor 20 mg qd, glucophage



Physical examination:  Reveals her to be obese weighing 231 lbs.  Her BP is 120/ palp in her left arm and her heart rate is 80. Her lungs are clear throughout.  Her apical impulse is non-displaced with a regular rate and rhythm, a normal S1 and S2, but no S3 or S4.  There is a grade 1 MR murmur noted.  There is no jugular venous distention and carotid pulses are 2+ bilaterally with soft bilateral bruits.  Her abdomen is morbidly obese.  Her extremities are notable for trace lower extremity edema.



EKG:  NSR with an old IPMI.  She also has non specific STT wave abnormalities.  When compared to a previous tracing there is no change. 



Impression:



1.CAD, s/p cath and stenting:  her angina is clearly related to her weight going up again; I worry about this, and wonder if she should have another weight loss surgery.  For the meantime, I will increase Imdur to 60 mg qd, and consider an increase in atenolol.

Nathan J Fernandes M.D. 



College Station, NC 22169



Dear Dr. Fernandes:



  Dr. Nunes and I had the pleasure to see your patient, Mr. Christian Mullen, this morning in the office for a routine vascular followup.  It has been nearly 18 months since his last visit here and in the interim time, has been having discomfort involving both of his hips, thighs, and calves.  As you well know, Mr. Mullen is a delightful 69-year-old gentleman with history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and peripheral arterial disease who previously underwent left common femoral and left popliteal artery revascularization November 2088 followed by right external, right internal, and right common femoral artery revascularization in February 2089.  Despite the technical success of both procedures, he continued to have bilateral hip claudication symptoms.  When we had last evaluated him in November 2089, we had considered moving forward with CT angiography to assess the patency of his aorto-iliac anatomy.  At the time, he favored moving on a conservative course with improved walking regimen and weight loss.  Unfortunately, despite these measures, he feels quite disabled and limited by his claudication symptoms.  Symptoms are noticeable between 20 and 50 yards distance occurring in the hip area as well as extending down in to his thigh and occasionally the calves.  Symptoms resolve with sitting and resting for approximately 2.5 minutes.  He notes that symptoms will improve with standing still however sitting symptoms resolve much quicker.  He does not necessarily notice any change with inclines or going up stairs; in fact, he is actually able to climb 18 stairs to his office without limitation.



From the cardiac perspective, Mr. Mullen has been free of any symptoms of exertional chest tightness, pressure, or shortness of breath.  We understand that you are following him in closely in this regard and now requesting up coming chemical stress test given that has been nearly 10 years from his coronary artery bypass surgery.



	Past medical history:

   Hypertension.

Hyperlipidemia.

CAD.

PAD.

Prior tobacco use.

Obesity.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Depressive disorder.

Cervical spine disease.

Congenital hypospadias.

Prostatitis.

Hemorrhoids.

Colonic polyps.

Chronic normocytic anemia.



	Medications (Confirmed):

	

aspirin  325 mg qd

Atacand  15 mg qd

doxepin 

glyburide 

Lipitor  80 mg qd

Lopid  600 mg BID

Toprol XL  50 mg qd

Wellbutrin 



Physical examination:

	

-Pulse:   66 and regular

-General:   Mr. Mullen is well appearing in no apparent distress

-Heent:   Benign

-Neck:   Carotids are 2+ without bruits

-Chest:   Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally without any wheezes, rhonchi, or rubs

-Cardiac:   Discloses regular rhythm with a rate of approximately 66 beats per minute.  S1 and S2.  There is no murmur, rub, or gallop

-Abdomen:   Obese, nontender, and nondistended.  There are no masses or bruits appreciated

-Extremities:   Reveals 1+ right femoral pulse with audible bruits.  Trace to 1+ left femoral pulse with audible bruit.  Distal pulses are 1+ without any evidence of edema, skin breakdown, or ulceration

-BP: 145/80    on the right



	Other Data:

   Three-vessel coronary artery bypass surgery 2082.

Status post C6-C7 disk surgery 2079.

Hypospadias repair in childhood.



	Assessment and plan:

   Mr. Christian Mullen is a delightful 69-year-old gentleman with history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, peripheral arterial disease with prior bilateral aortoiliac revascularization here for a vascular followup with symptoms of bilateral hip, buttock, thigh, and claudication.



Mr. Mullen's symptoms at present are suggestive of vascular claudication and in the sense that they are exertionally related.  Interestingly, he has had these symptoms dating back to immediately following his revascularization procedures in 2088 and 2089.  On examination today, his femoral pulses are certainly not robust and may suggest the presence of restenosis.  We discussed with Mr. Mullen the potential of going forward with lower extremity noninvasive studies; however, these revealed supra-normal ABIs in the past secondary to his diabetes.  Likewise, we discussed the possibility of moving forward with a non-invasive imaging study i.e. CT angiogram; however, this would not provide the option of therapeutic intervention if indeed narrowings were noted.  Accordingly, Mr. Mullen is in favor of proceeding forward with diagnostic peripheral angiography plus/minus therapeutic intervention if restenosis of his aortoiliac segments are noted.



It is indeed possible that there is a contributing factor of spinal stenosis in that Mr. Mullen's symptoms are relieved more quickly in the sitting position.  Likewise, he has noted improvement upon leaning forward and against a tree.  We understand that Mr. Mullen is being considered for an upcoming chemical stress test to assess the patency for any silent coronary ischemia.  He is quite reticent to go forward with the chemical stress test though we did broach the subject of performing coronary catheterization at the time of his peripheral angiogram given that we are actually going to be in there.  He has actually requested this as opposed to going forward with the chemical stress test.  With your permission, we will perform both coronary catheterization to assess the patency of his grafts in addition to his peripheral angiogram plus/minus therapeutic intervention of his lower extremities.



Paramount to his ongoing cardiovascular fitness, we certainly recommend blood pressure of 130/80 or below and LDL cholesterol 70 or below and ongoing exercise and weight loss.  We will plan to schedule his procedure in the upcoming weeks and he is to notify us if symptoms are progressed in the interim time.

I saw this patient and personally obtained the history of present illness.  I also reviewed and confirmed the PMH, medications, social and family history, and detailed ROS. I personally performed a comprehensive cardiovascular examination, including assessment of VS; auscultation of carotid arteries, lungs, heart, and abdomen; palpation of carotid arteries, evaluation of jugular venous pressure, palpation of abdominal aorta and lower extremity pulses and perfusion, and neurologic examination for focal deficits.  I interpreted the EKG and other pertinent laboratory data.  I discussed findings with the patient and personally developed the management strategy and plans.  My findings and plans are elaborated on the note above, with which I concur.  Guy Nunes M.D.

HPI: Asked to see patient by surgical team in consultation for is multiple medical issues. I have served as his PCP for eight years. Pt seen and examined. Case discussed in detail . This is a 62 y/o male with multiple medical issues last admitted in September for increased falls, found to have a small stroke in addition to his likely vascular dementia. Readmitted last week in the setting of Purulent L foot ulcer/ S/P debridement and later TMA. He has a long history well documented in the electronic medical record which is notable for poor compliance with medication and follow-up. At baseline, patient has declined further cardiology workup for his severe mitral regurgitation and cardiomyopathy, has declined treatment for his hyperlipidemia and takes his blood pressure medications with less than 25% compliance. At the time of his last admission, he was actually admitted to a nursing home with plans for long term placement.


The patient's wound has currently not been closed. He has a vac dressing in place. He has been attending dialysis per schedule of nephrology. Current hospital course has been complicated by increased agitation and last evening, self limited substernal chest pain and dyspnea. This resolved spontaneously. He has also been intermittently refusing his medications and has been attempting to ambulate.


This AM.  the patient actually denies ever experiencing chest pain. He also only recalls his foot pain with repeated prompting. He denies any pain, dyspnea

EKG: NSR @ 90, incomplete RBBB, L anterior fascicular block; QTC 495 ms.


Assessment/Plan
 In summary,62 y/o male with multiple medical issues as outlined in this and many other notes. Presenting with necrotic foot infection, polymicrobial. S/P Rt TMA. Mildly delerious and certainly off from a baseline that was tenuous to start.


By issue:


1) CAD: The patient does have CAD, MR and cardiomyopathy that are really not amenable to intervention, given patient noncompliance. The best goal at present is going to be continued medical management. If BP allows, could increase toprol XL, although I suspect that this will not be an option. In addition, would aim to keep even at dialysis.


Certainly, cycle CKs and troponin and follow sx. I will defer to Dr. Shah, but I don't see clear benefit for cardiac cath, especially as we are not going to proceed to valve repair at this juncture.  If he were to become more compliant, this might be another consideration and as he is now a CT resident, perhaps this will be a future consideration.


2) Delirium: He does have a very tenuous baseline and has significant vascular dementia to start. He is off of this baseline, likely reflecting sundowning, medications and underlying metabolic processes. Please d/c medications that might be contributing to sx. Fluoxetine can be held for now as it was only started 3 weeks prior. Might hold ranitidine as well.  Haldol is d/cd in the setting of his prolonged QTc. Currently on olanzapine. Would continue to follow QTc closely and would d/c this med as well is still prolonged. Please send urine culture and surveillance blood cultures.


3) Infection: Appreciate excellent surgical management of patient's wound. Levofloxacin has been d/cd  2nd to concerns for altered mental status. All bacteria are sensitive to aztreonam so perhaps this would be a reasonable alternative. Would seek ID input to the end. Wound care per vascular with plans for D/C when stable and return for closure in the future. 
4) ESRD: Patient HAD dialysis today . Recs per nephrology
3) DM: HgA1c was at target. Please cover as needed with RISS for now. 5) Competency: certainly not able to make informed decisions at this time. Please confirm that his daughter is his HCP. Would try to use a Chadian interpreter and not daughters if at all possible.
 Thanks,

EDVISIT^43294739^FINNEY, INDIANA^12/15/90^MARTIN, CONSTANCE

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 53-year-old female

with a history of insulin-dependent diabetes, hypertension and

atrial fibrillation who comes in to the ER complaining of

sensation of a racing heart since 5:10 p.m. in the evening.  She

said it was acute onset and felt like palpitations.  She also

said it felt like a burning.  She had mild shortness of breath

and left arm achiness.  She had no nausea, no vomiting, no fevers

or chills.  She had no trauma, no lightheadedness, and no

syncope.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension, insulin-dependent diabetes,

and atrial fibrillation.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Not related.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  No tobacco or occasional alcohol.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Reviewed and noncontributory.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Palpitations, otherwise negative.

MEDICATIONS:  Metoprolol, the patient missed two doses today,

aspirin, simvastatin, glyburide and NovoLog.

ALLERGIES:  Erythromycin and IV dye.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 97, heart rate 155,

respiratory rate 18, blood pressure 136/52, O2 100% on 2 liters. 

The patient is awake and alert, well developed, well nourished,

talking in complete sentences, in no acute distress.  ENT: 

Atraumatic, normal to inspection.  Eyes are normal.  Neck: 

Normal to inspection, supple, and nontender.  Respiratory:  Clear

to auscultation bilaterally.  Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and

rhythm.  No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  GI:  Abdomen is soft and

nontender.  Skin is intact, warm, and dry.  Back is nontender. 

Musculoskeletal:  No lower extremity swelling or edema. 

Neuropsychiatric:  Oriented x3.  Mood and affect is normal. 

Cranial nerves II through XII tested and intact.  No motor or

sensory deficits.

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  Initial EKG showed a rate of about

150, unclear.  It seemed that there was T waves in V3.  There is

no evidence of ST elevation MI.  We thought this could be an SVT.

 It was not really consistent with an atrial fibrillation.  Our

plan was to give adenosine, however, during the IV placement. 

Prior to giving adenosine, the patient converted to a normal

sinus rhythm with mild tachycardia at around 100, but it was

clear that there was T waves.  At this point, we decided to give

her baseline metoprolol dose and she missed two doses.

LABORATORY DATA:  Labs checked include sodium of 139, potassium

3.7, chloride 104, bicarbonate 23, BUN 14, creatinine 0.81,

glucose 268.  ALT 19, AST 18, CK 350, alkaline phosphatase 128,

total bilirubin 0.5, CK-MB 5.2, troponin I less than 0.04,

calcium 9.1, and mag 1.9.  White blood cells 10.29, hematocrit

42.7, and platelets 438, 000.  INR is 1.  UA is negative for

infection with trace blood present.

PLAN:  Our plan is to check two more enzymes because the patient

had the left arm heaviness during the palpitations.  If both of

those enzymes are negative, we feel that she is safe to go home

from the ED Observation Unit.  It is unclear the etiology of her

arrhythmia.  It did seem to be likely SVT, which broke

spontaneously.  The patient is to follow up with her primary

doctor.

DISPOSITION:  ED Observation Unit.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Satisfactory.

I confirm that I have interviewed and examined the patient,

reviewed the resident's documentation, the patient's chart,

discussed the evaluation, plan of care, and disposition with the

patient.

Neurology resident consult note
 


Patient Name:      Leon

MRN:                      43634211

Date:                      0021

Consult reason:  
?abnormal gait



HPI:  53RHM who going to bed Wednesday was in usoh, but Thursday 2:30AM awoke w/ terrible HA, so came to ED; got CT head and LP, both negative for blood. However, BP was reportedly as high as 190/106 (and wife says she&#8217;s measured it this high at home at least once in past 2 weeks), and blood glucose 400s. I see no LMR note about the visit, but am told that he was given some medication for his BP, given some insulin and a Rx for insulin, and instructed to see his PCP the next day, and discharged. Friday he did see his PCP, who told him not to take insulin but to take oral DM meds instead, and told him to return to the ED b/c he still had a terrible HA, so he came back to the EDUCARE-PULLMAN ED tonight. He was given caffeine, ibuprofen, Tylenol, and compazine, reported that his HA was gone. However, a staff physician in the ED on exam noted a wide based gait. An MRI was originally ordered, but canceled when it came to notice that he has an implanted device to prevent syncope that precludes MRI. Neurology is now consulted.to comment on his gait and other sx. 



Patient and his wife tell me that his gait is baseline, and has been as it is for years; they have noticed no change and have no complaints. 

He is very unpleasant and un-forthcoming about his history, slow to cooperate w/ exam; says he wants to go home, resents being in the ED still now that his HA is gone. 



VS in ED tonight: BP 172/95 max, but mostly 150-160s; temp 98, hr 89, 100% RA

Blood glucose not measured tonight. 



ROS: 

Negative for: changes in vision or hearing, neck pain, tinnitus, vertigo, weakness, numbness, difficulty with comprehension, speaking, language, swallowing, eating, balance or gait. 

General review of systems negative for:  fevers, chills, rashes, change in weight, energy level or appetite, chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath, cough, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and change in bowel or bladder habits (i.e incontinence). 



MEDS: metoprolol, omeprazole, simvastatin (he is unsure whether this is all)

ALL: nkda

PMH: 

-HTN; he denies prior dx of DM before yesterday night

-recurrent cardiogenic syncope, for which he has had &#8220;Reveal&#8221; device implanted, then explanted b/c of pain, then recurrent sycope and reimplantation of device, after which syncope stopped (see notes in LMR from Dr. Susan Root)



SH: denies t/e/d, works as &#8220;Pipefitter&#8221;

FH: HTN, DM



Neurologic Examination: 

MS: unpleasant, uncooperative w/ history, angry about being in the ED still

AOx3, appropriately interactive and conversational. Normal affect. 

Speech is fluent with intact comprehension and repetition, no paraphasic errors. 

Concentration and attention intact. 

CN: Visual fields full to confrontation; pupils equal and reactive 3&gt;2 direct and concensual; no ptosis; 

Extraocular movements full without nystagmus; facial sensation to LT normal. 

Hearing intact to finger rub bilaterally; face, tongue and palate are symmetric; SCM and traps 5/5.

Motor: Normal bulk and tone; no tremor, rigidity, or bradykinesia. No pronator drift. Finger tapping normal.

Sensory: Intact/symmetric LT/PP/T/JPS throughout.   

Reflexes: absent throughout. 


Cerebellar: Finger-nose-finger, rapid alternating movements, heel-knee-shin normal and symmetric b/l.

Gait: Slightly wide based. Normal arm swing, normal speed. Able to walk on toes and heels. Some difficulty w/ tandem walk. Negative Romberg. 



A/P:  53RHM w/ HTN urgency yesterday, newly diagnosed DM w/ FS in 300-400s yesterday, who yesterday presented w/ new HA and negative w/u for SAH, now back again for same HA, which has finally resolved in apparently in concert w/ some improvement in BP (current BP 150s) and w/ medications. Neurology was specifically consulted for his gait, which does appear a bit wide-based, but he and wife confirm that this is chronic, and I strongly doubt any relation to his current HA problems. Most obvious medical issues to focus on here are his poorly controlled HTN, which I suspect is the primary cause of his HA, and his uncontrolled DM, of which he obviously does not yet understand the import and does not seem likely to comply with insulin treatment without further education. 



In any case, I find no acute neurological issues. 



Recs: 

-BP management

-DM management. 



Thanks for this interesting consult. 

Case/plan discussed w/ KEKELA neurology attending by phone, Dr. Ivan Guy. 

Call w/ questions 86383. 



Keith Gilbert, MD, PhD, 

Neurology resident PGY3



Addendum: 

He did not mention this when I questioned him and wife about PMH, but digging through prior LMR notes I find this addition to his PMH: 

A note from Dr. Robert Irish, neurosurgery, from 3/2099 notes that he is s/p &#8220;cervical laminectomy and foramen magnum resection followed by removal of an intramedullary tumor near his foramen magnum.  He is doing much better today.  He states that his headaches are considerably better, and the left hemibody dysesthesias are much better tolerated since the initiation of Neurontin.&#8221;

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Mr. Nicholas Xavier is a 73-year-old man who
returns to the Orlando Regional today for a quick follow up on his
left foot ulceration.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Glucovance 5/500 mg b.i.d. and Actos 30 mg
q.d.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The ulceration has not significantly
changed, but there are no new signs of infection.  He has been
taking Keflex 500 mg t.i.d. for the last seven days.  He denies
fever and his blood glucose levels have started to improve a
little bit.  His fingerstick blood sugar today is 145.

He has an appointment in Vascular Surgery in two days.  I have
asked him that it is extremely important for him to keep that
appointment for the evaluation of this ulceration and his
vascular status.  I have also reviewed with him that he may need
to be hospitalized if a vascular procedure is recommended.

Unfortunately, he does not have an appointment with Podiatry
until the end of this month.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  He will be seen by me again in a few days
after he is seen in Vascular Surgery.  In the meantime, he will
continue with all his medications.  I have given him a
prescription for Zocor 20 mg q.d. since the pharmacy could not
give him Lipitor that I had prescribed.

RE:  		Jaquante Xuereb

SRI: 		134-43-51



Dear Dr. You:



I had the pleasure of seeing our mutual patient, Mr. Jaquante Xuereb, in follow up evaluation in our vascular surgery clinic here at the Santa Rosa Infirmary today.  As you remember, he recently underwent a revision of his lower extremity bypass graft with thrombectomy of the fem-pop bypass graft and subsequent jump graft to the below-knee popliteal artery.  He returns today for follow up evaluation. 



He has a warm, well-perfused foot with a palpable dorsalis pedis pulse.  Unfortunately, over the last ten days he has developed increased erythema and tenderness on the medial aspect of his left knee with superficial skin breakdown consistent with either a staph or a strep cellulitis.  He had been on a course of p.o. antibiotics over a week ago for treatment of strep throat as well.  The patient has been increased his activity and prior to this time had been extremely active with no erythema, tenderness or drainage from his leg.  My concern is that he has increased warmth with blanching and erythema on the medial aspect of his knee consistent with a superficial cellulitis and I believe that he would benefit from hospital admission with a course of IV antibiotics, bedrest and elevate.  We will tentatively plan to admit him for localized wound care measures, treatment with IV Nafcillin on a q.4 hour basis.  In addition, he has intact femoral pulses on the left side.  He does report when he was ambulating he was having increased difficulty with claudication in the distal left lower extremity and calf region.  Most recent vascular lab studies dated November 29, 2070 reveal an ABI of 0.96 on the right, 0.56 on the left.  



I will keep you informed as to the status of Mr. Xuereb.  My concern is that if he does infect this PTFE graft we do not have any suitable autogenous conduit to perform an additional reconstruction and he would stand a very high chance of losing his limb at the knee level.  If I can be of any further assistance in the management of this or any of your other patients with vascular disease, particularly those in need of a minimally invasive vascular procedure, please feel free to contact me directly.





Sincerely,





Shane R. Herring, M.D.

Patient Name: XUEREB, JAQUANTE;  MRN: 1344351

Dictated on: 04/27/2071 by LILLIAN STEELE, N.P., PH.D. 



 

Mr. Xuereb returns to clinic for evaluation and management of recurrent ulcerations on the hypertrophic scar tissue along the medial aspect of the right lower extremity.  

 

Today, on physical examination, the wound bed measured 1 cm x 0.7 cm.  The wound bed was covered with yellow biofilm, which was debrided.  The underlying wound bed contained moist red tissue with a few drops of bloody drainage.  The margin was clear.  

 

IMPRESSION:  There has been epithelialization of the wound along the medial aspect of the right knee.  There has been no further disruption of the epithelium overlying the hypertrophic scar tissue.   



PLAN:  We will continue with dressing changes every two to three days per the following protocol: spray the wound with AllClenz wound cleanser followed by irrigation with normal saline 30 cc x 3; apply skin protectant to the periwound margin, Panafil paste 1/8"" thick to the wound bed, gauze dampened with normal saline (cut-to-fit), covered with DuoDerm secured with Medipore tape.  

 

Mr. Xuereb will return to clinic in two weeks.

                                                         Date of Visit: 05/11/2089





REASON FOR VISIT:  Mr. Jarvis comes for a regular 6-month followup 
visit.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  He has been feeling extremely well without 
any illness or any unpleasant symptoms.  He is working hard as a production manager, and he will have some time off this spring.  He and his wife are 
planning a trip to Italy and Greece, and following this, they will spend mostly 
long weekends in New Mexico.

He has not had shortness of breath, orthopnea, or edema.  The pains in his hips 
and legs have not been bothering him.  When he tests his blood glucose level, he 
gets results that range between 170 and 120.  He has not been specifically 
exercising, but does try to park his car at some distance from shops and stores 
and walk the intervening distance.  He continues on 1/2 tablet of atenolol 50 mg 
per day along with 1 Hyzaar tablet per day.  Otherwise, the review of systems is 
unremarkable.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  He looks cheerful and fit.  Blood pressure in the 
right arm, sitting 140/86 with regular pulse 64.  Chest is clear to P&A.  Heart 
sounds are very faint, but appear normal with normal rate and rhythm.  Neck 
veins are not distended.  Abdomen is nontender.  Extremities have good dorsalis 
pedis pulses.  Sensation in feet is intact to light touch and vibration.

IMPRESSION:  Very stable with regards to hypertension.  He remains 
moderately hyperglycemic.  He has an appointment to be followed by the 
urologist, Dr. Jose Quirk, in the next month for his elevated prostatic-
specific antigen (the prostate biopsy showed intraepithelial neoplasia   
considered only a risk factor).

PLAN:  We will check the usual laboratory work, and we will let him know when 
the results are available.  He should return in 6 months.

Mr Jarvis: The glucose when you were here was 244 and the average calclated from the HbA1c is 171; despite your efforts and exercise and diet.  I think it would be wise to start on a low dose of a glucose-lowering medicine, glipizide (Glucotrol).  I would start on 1/2 of a 5 mg pill twice a day and continue checking your blood sugar levels from time to time.  If they stay a bit up, then increase to one whole pill (5 mg) twice a day.  Then we will see how that effects the blood sugar.  I don't think this will interfere with your trip.  Call me in a week to tell me how it is going.



Best wishes,

RADIOLOGICAL STUDIES


CT brain w/o contrast: No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage, mass-effect, midline shift or acute territorial infarction. Chronic healed naso-orbito-ethmoid fracture.

CXR - Progression of predominantly bibasilar nodular and interstitial opacities, possibly be due to chronic aspiration. Recommend CT.



EKG

Nsr 94 bpm, LAD, no Q waves, no ST-T changes

            

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

78 yo M with DM, HTN, ulcers, indwelling SPC who presents with one week of feeling &#8220;lousy&#8221; and a maximum temperature of 104 degrees F.  Exam was remarkable for LLE erythema consistent with cellulitis.  Labs were notable for a high WBC with a neutrophilic predominance and a clean urinalysis.  Given his history of fever, exam, and lab studies, infection is the most likely cause of Mr. Flaherty&#8217;s current presentation.  



ISSUE #1: Fever and leukocytosis


Most likely secondary to cellulitis vs wound infection

Blood cultures, urine cultures, wound cultures, and respiratory cultures

Panculture if SPIKES

f/u microbiology c and s

start broad spectrum antibiotics: Vancomycin 1 g q12 IV for presumed MRSA and Unasyn 3000 mg IV q6 for presumed gram negatives (with minimal anaerobe coverage)

if clinically decompensates, will consider Zosyn for pseudomonal coverage and Flagyl for anaerobe coverage



ISSUE #2: Diabetes Mellitus


continue with home regimen of metformin 1000 bid and lantus 14 SC

insulin sliding scale for coverage

FSBG AC+HS

Last A1C 8.4 8/1/26



ISSUE #3: HTN


Continue with home regimen of lisinopril 40 mg daily, atenolol 50 mg daily

Monitor and titrate as needed



ISSUE #4: Home safety and cleanliness


Will ask for assistance from social work and case management re: potential need of home safety evaluation

Assess for competency &#8211; re: safety at home



FEN: diabetic diet, replete lytes prn, will bolus 1000 cc NS



PROPHYLAXIS

GI: omeprazole

DVT: Fragmin

BOWEL: Colace, Senna prn

RE:Nicholas-Xaviar, FredMR #65856594

 

Dear Dr. Vanpelt,

 

I had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Nicholas-Xavier in follow up after his 

recent coronary artery bypass graft surgery. I followed him in the hospital 

when he was admitted in Apr for a left foot ulcer.  As you know, he is a 77 

year-old man from Eritrea with a history of diabetes, hypertension and 

hyperlipidemia, as well as peripheral vascular disease who has had bilateral 

lower extremity bypasses in the past. 

 

He was admitted in Apr of 2091 with a nonhealing left lower extremity ulcer 

for lower extremity redo bypass surgery.  His preoperative evaluation 

included 

a Dobutamine echocardiogram, which revealed a small area of Dobutamine 

induced 

hypokinesis in the inferior wall.  Since this was a small area, it was felt 

he 

could proceed with surgery with moderate risk on a beta-blocker.  He 

underwent 

left lower extremity peripheral bypass surgery and did well postoperative 

with 

no symptoms of chest pain and no change in his EKG.

 

However postoperative enzymes revealed peak CK of 455 with an MB fraction of 

35 and a troponin of 19.5.  As a result of his large troponin leak, he 

underwent cardiac catheterization on Apr 15, 2091 which revealed an 80% left 

main stenosis, 100% totally occluded left anterior descending coronary 

artery, 

100% proximal first diagonal and a 60-70% lesion at the ostium of the 

posterior descending coronary artery with about a 50% lesion in the distal 

PDA. 

 

Postoperative echocardiogram on Apr 13, 2091 revealed an ejection fraction of 

45% with _________ apical hypokinesis and mild mitral insufficiency.  Due to 

his severe left main stenosis, he underwent coronary artery bypass grafting 

on 

Apr 20, 2091. He had LIMA to his left anterior descending artery and a vein 

graft to his obtuse marginal artery.  He did not have a graft to his 

posterior 

descending artery since he had a limit to the number of conduits secondary

to his multiple peripheral vascular surgeries.

 

Postoperatively he did quite well and was discharged to rehabilitation on 

April 

27, 2091.  His medications on discharge were aspirin 325mg, Zocor 20mg, 

Subcutaneous Heparin 5000 units b.i.d., Metformin 500mg, Glipizide 10 in the 

morning and 5 in the evening, Captopril 12.5 t.i.d. and Lopressor 25mg q.i.d.

 

Since that time, he has done quite well. He has been progressing at 

rehabilitation to the point that he is now walking ten minutes three times 

per 

day and is working on walking up stairs since he lives on the second floor of 

his house.  He denies any chest pain with walking.  He has no shortness of 

breath or dyspnea on exertion.  He has been sleeping on two pillows for a 

long 

time and this is unchanged.  He denies paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea or 

claudication symptoms with walking at this time.  He does complain of some 

pain in his left shin just below his knee, particularly with palpation. He 

has 

plans to be discharged from rehabilitation in a few days.

On physical examination, his blood pressure is 135/80 with a heart rate of 

60. 

 His jugular venous pressure is flat, and he has good carotid upstrokes 

without carotid bruits.  His lungs are clear to auscultation and percussion 

bilaterally.  His heart has a slight laterally displaced PMI with a regular 

rate and rhythm, normal S1, and S2 and no audible murmur or gallop.  His 

chest 

incision as well as his lower extremity and arm incisions is healing well. He 

has a small scrape on the inner aspect of his left leg, which is also healing 

well.  There is some red discoloration below this lesion that is not warm and 

does not appear to be cellulitic.  His feet are warm.

 

His EKG in my office reveals normal sinus rhythm at 60 with T wave inversions 

in V1 through V5, 1 and L.  They are particularly deep in V2 and V3 but are 

unchanged from his discharge EKG from the hospital.

 

In summary, Mr. Nicholas-Xaviar is a 77 year-old gentleman with diabetes, 

hypertension, hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease and peripheral vascular 

disease who is two weeks status post coronary artery bypass grafting and 

three 

weeks left lower extremity bypass who is doing quite well in his recovery.  

He 

will continue with rehabilitation and increase his exercise capacity over 

time. I have reassured him and his granddaughter that he is doing very well 

and that it will take up to two months until he feels back to his baseline. 

 

I have recommended to him and to his rehabilitation facility that he increase 

his Zocor from 20-40mg q.h.s.  I have also changed him to once daily cardiac 

regimen so I have changed his

Captopril to Lisinopril 20mg q.d. and his Lopressor to Toprol XL 100mg p.o. 

q.d..  He will follow up with me in three months time or sooner if he 

develops 

any new symptoms of chest pain, shortness of breath or any new cardiac 

concerns.

 

He was seen, examined and discussed with Dr. Steve Franks.  Thank you for 

allowing me to participate in his care.

 

Sincerely,

I saw this patient with Dr. Sawyer.  I confirm that I have

interviewed and examined the patient, reviewed the resident's

documentation on the patient's chart, and discussed the

evaluation, plan of care, and disposition with the patient.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Heart is racing.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 52-year-old female

with history of diabetes mellitus type 2 and sarcoid, who

presents with onset one hour prior to admission of left arm

pressure and heart racing.  The patient denies shortness of

breath.  She has no nausea, vomiting, and no fevers or chills. 

She says that she has occasionally had these symptoms in the

past, they have already stopped on their own.  Tonight, they

lasted for approximately 30 minutes prior to calling EMS.  En

route EMS took 12-lead ECG showing a rate of 150, suspected a

flutter and was given 20 mg diltiazem by EMS with no response. 

She describes feeling in her left arm as dull pain, it is 3/10,

and it has not made better or worse by anything.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Please see paper chart.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Please see paper chart.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Please see paper chart.

MEDICATIONS:  Please see paper chart.

ALLERGIES:  Please see paper chart.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  None.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Reviewed and noncontributory.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  A middle-aged African-American woman,

awake, alert, and in mild distress.  Exam limited by obesity. 

Exam is significant for neck; normal to inspection, supple,

nontender, and unable to appreciate JVP.  Respiratory:  No

distress.  Chest:  Nontender and normal breath sounds. 

Cardiovascular:  Tachycardic at 115 and regular and 2/6 systolic

ejection murmur, no gallop, and no friction rub.  Abdomen:  Soft,

nontender, no organomegaly, and no masses, otherwise, as

documented on the paper chart.

IMAGING STUDIES:  ECG shows a flutter at 150 beats per minute in

ECG #1.  ECG final shows a sinus rhythm at approximately 60 beats

per minute with no signs of ischemia.

IMPRESSION:  The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history

of occasional brief palpitations now with one hour of continuous

palpitations and ECG consistent with atrial flutter.  She was

given 20 mg of diltiazem IV by EMS.  In the Emergency Department,

she was given 20 mg without significant response, followed by 40

mg ID and was achieved a good response.  As the patient required

a significant amount of diltiazem to slow her rate and convert

her and she is also feeling somewhat nervous, we will keep her in

the Observation Unit overnight.  She should get an oral dose of

diltiazem overnight.  She should get cardiac monitoring in the

morning.

PLAN:  To discuss with KEKELA Cardiology and obtain consultation as

to possible discharge on beta-blockers versus calcium channel

blockers.  If the patient does not have a new symptoms she would

be stable for discharge in the morning.

PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS:  Atrial flutter with rapid ventricular

response.

SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS:  Left arm pain.

CRITICAL CARE TIME:  35 minutes.

Cardiac Access Admission Note

Russell P Urban

# 472 20 64



9/19/95



Mr Urban is admitted s/p PTCA/stent x 2 (Cyphers) to his LCX today



History of Present Illness	

     This 52 yo gentleman has known CAD dating back to an MI in 7/93. He underwent RCA stenting at that time, jailing the RV marginal with sluggish flow afterward. Post MI ECHO showed EF of 36% w/diffuse HK.

     He underwent f/u ETT w/imaging in 8/93 which showed a small fixed inferior defect with considerable residual viable myocardium and no evidence of ischemia. EF at that time was 51%. He has done reasonably well since then.

    In late spring, Mr Urban noted some chest tightness and SOB similar in quality to his prior angina, but markedly less severe, which occurred with exertion. He had a repeat ETT 7/31/95. EKG was positive for ischemia. Imaging showed a defect that was c/w ischemia. His meds were adjsuted, but his symptoms have persisted.

    Today he presented for elective cath +/- via SDA. Cath showed his RCA to be totally occluded, with 2 LCX lesions. His LCX was stented with 2 cyphers (3.5 x13 and 3 x 23) with good results. He was put on reopro and transferred to Cardiology where he arrived pain free and in no distress.

Increase ASA to 325 mg QD and add plavix 75 mg QD indefinitely. He is at high risk of progressive disease given his early RCA ISR. Continue reopro as ordered. Remove sheaths once PTT normalizes. Ambulate once activity restrictions lifted.

     Continue heart healthy diet, exercise, meds as ordered. Weigh daily, strict I&O given hx CHF after his MI. LP(a) was 24 last draw- Dr Orozco will consider adding niaspan after evaluating effect of zetia/lipitor in clinic.

                                              6-19-59
 
 
 
HPI:  This is a regularly scheduled visit for this Eva Ruledge a 
44-year old woman with a history of hypertension and borderline obesity.  
She was last here in February with no complaints, but did have an elevated 
creatinine for which she was referred to the Internal Medicine for further 
evaluation.  The patient did not, however, present to the Internal Medicine as 
planned.  She states that she has been ""too busy.""  Her only complaint 
today is of some right leg pain, which she says is chronic and which is 
relieved to some extent by acetaminophen.  
 
Eva continues to take Procardia XL 30 mg. PO q.day.  A noted in her 
ambulatory record, the Procardia is prescribed as a b.i.d. drug, however, 
Eva believes it gives her headaches and refuses to take it other than 
on an almost p.r.n. basis.  
 
Review of systems is essentially normal.  Specifically, she denies any 
headaches, any chest pain, any shortness of breath.  She also denies any 
symptoms or signs referable to her urinary tract.  She has no history of 
dysuria, of frequent urinary tract infection, or of hematuria.
 
Physical Examination:  She is robust appearing.  Vital signs are 
significant for a blood pressure of 140/100.  HEENT exam is unremarkable.  
Lungs are clear.  Cardiac exam reveals a regular rate and rhythm, a normal 
S1, S2.  No S3 is appreciated.  There are no murmurs or rubs.  Abdomen is 
slightly obese, nontender, and with normal bowel sounds.  No masses are 
appreciated.  Lower extremities are without edema and joint exam does not 
suggest effusion or limitation of her range of motion.  Indeed, exam of 
her legs is entirely unremarkable.  
 
Laboratory:  Will include a repeat creatinine, a urinalysis and urine 
sediment and a urine creatinine.
 
Assessment and Plan:
 
1.   Hypertension:  Eva has had persistently elevated blood pressure 
     on her Procardia.  I have asked her to stop taking Procardia, which 
     she blames for headaches and to begin taking taking atenolol, 
     beginning at 50 mg. PO q.day.  I will see her in a few days in order 
     to make sure that she is not having any difficulties with this drug 
     and also to check her blood pressure once again.
 
2.   Right leg pain:  This would appear to be chronic and may well be 
     related to her work, which requires her to scuttle throughout the 
     hospital at fairly high speed (She is a Pulping Control Operator.)  I  have asked her to continue taking 
     Tylenol and we will re-evaluate her need for more powerful agents, 
     such as nonsteroidals if the need arises.

                                              6-19-59
 
 
 
3.   Elevated creatinine:  Unfortunately, Eva has not kept her Renal 
     appointment.  In order to prevent this from recurring a third time, I 
     have called and made an appointment for her with Dr. Eileen Xayavong.  
     She is to see him on the 29th of this month at 1:00 p.m. and I have 
     also left a message on his E mail mentioning Eva to him.  
     Hopefully, he can help ultrasound identify the etiology of this 
     elevated creatinine before there is further loss of her kidney 
     function.  
 
4.   Health Maintenance:  The patient was scheduled to have a Pap smear 
     today, but again was ""too busy to stay that long.""  She is to see me 
     again shortly, and a Pap smear will be done at that time.  Her 
     February mammogram was essentially not suggestive of malignancy and 
     will not be repeated until next year.

The patient was interviewed and examined by me and Dr. Chase.  

Please see the note for full details.

HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  This patient is a very pleasant 

gentleman accompanied by his wife who gives most of the history 

complaining of bleeding in the right groin.  He is status post 

catheterization and stent approximately two weeks.  He was recently 

discharged from rehabilitation and at home his wife found the right 

groin to be soaked in blood.  The patient's wife also noticed some 

swelling at the site.  He has had no fevers and no chills.  He has 

recently been diagnosed with myelodysplastic syndrome with white 

counts in the 30's.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Review of systems is notable for bleeding only. 

He denies any abdominal pain.  He denies any fever or chills.  No 

neurologic complaints.  No distal neurovascular complaints either.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  The patient's past medical history is 

notable for diabetes, hypertension as well as cerebrovascular 

accident, gastrointestinal bleed and myelodysplasia.  Surgeries and 

procedures are as above.

MEDICATIONS:  The patient's medications include Plavix and aspirin.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no allergies. 

SOCIAL HISTORY AND FAMILY HISTORY:  No current tobacco or ethyl 

alcohol.  He lives at home with his wife.  He has VNA services 

although they are not coming tomorrow.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  I agree with the physical examination as 

documented.  GENERAL:  The patient is an awake, alert, pleasant 

male in no apparent distress.  VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 96, pulse 

56, respiratory rate 20, blood pressure 97/49, oxygen saturation 

96%.  EXTREMITIES:  The right groin shows a slightly tender area 

with a little bit of ooze but dried blood.  No active bleeding 

right now.  Distally he has popliteal pulses.  He has bilateral 

dopplerable dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses.  He has 

full range of motion and denies any numbness.

-check TTE r/o endocarditis
-cont to cycle cardiac enzymes
-follow EKGs

BACTEREMIA
-Likely seeded blood stream from cellulitis due to strep, must also consider enterococcus
-Minimal response to vanco overnight
-gentamicin x 1 dose to cover anaerobes/GN
-consider VRE, ?source
-surveillance cultures
-TTE as above

	CARDIOLOGY
	

	SAINT VINCENT HOSPITAL
	


	Interval History:
   Ursula is seen in the Cardiology office for a followup visit.  Since last seen, she notes a number of somewhat concerning symptoms.  First of all, she is noting some mid sternal chest discomfort with exertion.  She associates this with back pain related to a remote back injury, but nonetheless with exertions she develops some degree of mid sternal chest discomfort, non radiating, associated may be with some shortness of breath.  She has not used any nitroglycerin for it.  It gets better when she rests.  She denies palpitations, PND, or orthopnea.  Her sugars are out of control.  Her weight is down, nonetheless.

Physical examination:
	
-Pulse:   80
-BP: 130/85  
-weight:   206 lbs.
-General:   Overweight.  Well appearing.
-Skin:   No rashes.  Anicteric.
-Heent:   Unremarkable.
-Neck:   JVP less than 5, possible venous hums bilaterally.  Carotids without bruits.
-Chest:   Clear to auscultation and percussion.
-Cardiac:   Apical impulse nondisplaced and discrete.  Regular rate and rhythm.  Normal S1 and split S2.  Soft S4 gallop.
-Abdomen:   Obese, soft, nontender, and nondistended without hepatosplenomegaly, bruits, dilated aorta.
-Extremities:   No clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.

Procedures:
	
Electrocardiogram  normal sinus rhythm IVCD, old IMI.  In addition, she has nonspecific ST and T-wave changes.  Compared there is no important change.


	Impression:
   1.  Coronary artery disease status post multiple PCIs.  Ursula has the return of chest symptoms which are suggestive for angina.  I will refer her for an exercise tolerance test to better evaluate this.  I will continue on the current medication program.
2.  Hypertension.  Her blood pressure is a bit elevated.  Given her diabetes, I think it is prudent to add an ACE inhibitor.  Accordingly, lisinopril 2.5 mg QD was added to her program.
3.  Lipids will be checked.  I strongly suspect that her LDL is not well suppressed.  Our goal LDL in this case is less than 70 mg/dL.

                          OFFICE NOTE
George, Rickey
MRN: 1131414
06/10/92

REASON FOR VISIT:  Scheduled follow up of multiple medical problems.

PROBLEMS:
1.   Status post removal of infected AICD and pacer.  Admitted to Massillon Community 12/91 with infection of his AICD and permanent pacer.  He was managed by multiple
services including EP, Cardiology, and ID.  His OR cultures grew candida and he was treated
with a prolonged course of fluconazole.  Although he had runs of NSVT, he was managed
effectively with carvedilol.  Notably his digoxin was stopped because of bradycardia during the
hospitalization. He never had any sustained VT or VF.  He was subsequently discharged home
with a Life vest defibrillator.

He has done well with no recurrent evidence of infection.  He currently has no AICD or
pacemaker but saw Dr. Cook yesterday and apparently he is being evaluated for new hardware
for his arrhythmia issues.  He has a history of both VF arrest and sick sinus syndrome.  Currently
his heart rate is slightly irregular but a reasonable rate and he will continue on his current
regimen as prescribed by Dr. Cook with close follow up.  

2.   CHF.  Immediately after his discharge from CCGH after his hospitalization, he went
directly to West Virginia where his wife was able to care for him. He had one episode of CHF, which
was managed as an outpatient, and he is now on slightly doses of Lasix than previously.  At the
present time, he has no active symptoms of CHF, he continues to sleep on two large pillows at
night without symptoms of orthopnea and has minimal to no peripheral edema.  He does
continue on an ACE inhibitor and potassium along with his Lasix. 

3.   Coronary artery disease.  Despite all of his active issues, he has no current symptoms of
angina and has tolerated his multiple recent procedures well.

4.   Status post infected (staph) left knee arthroplasty.  His left TKR also required removal
due to infection and he had replacement of new hardware by Dr. Judd 10/91.  He has had no
recurrent infection, but his rehabilitation has been more limited because of his other medical
issues.  He does report that he was swimming in the pool and doing things on his own while
down in West Virginia, but we will make a formal rehab referral now that he is back in the Mexico area.

5.   Diabetes mellitus.  Throughout his numerous medical problems over the past six to
twelve months, he has had a significant weight loss and not surprisingly, his diabetes regimen
has been gradually decreased.  He is now on Glyburide 5 mg b.i.d. and he reports that his fasting
sugars which he is checking about three times a week are running quite good in the 100 to 120
range.  He has no complaints of hypoglycemia or blood sugars greater than 200.  We will check
his HbA1c today and continue his current regimen.

MRN: 1131414

6.   Hyperlipidemia.  He continues on Lipitor.  We'll recheck his fasting lipids, LFTs and
CPK.

7.   Diabetic nephropathy.  He remains on ACE inhibitor and will check renal function today
to re-establish baseline.

8.   Status post CVA.  Known moderate right carotid stenosis.  Minimal residual dysarthria
and right-sided weakness. Has had no recent neurologic symptoms and remains on Coumadin.

PHYSICAL EXAM:  Blood pressure by palpation 130.  Was unable to get sufficient blood
pressure by cuff.  Pulse 60, mostly irregular. General, thin, but no distress.  Lungs, clear to
auscultation and percussion.  Cor, distant heart sounds.  No S3 appreciated. Old pacer/AICD site. 
No evidence of erythema or fluctuance.  Extremities, trace edema bilaterally.

DISPOSITION:  Close ongoing follow up.

ADDENDUM:  In reviewing patient's medical records after he left today, I found mention of
both hematuria and guaiac positive stool during his recent hospitalizations.  At this time, he was
quite debilitated and I do not think it would be a good time for colonoscopy.  He did deny
abdominal symptoms as part of my review of systems today.  

At this point, my plan will be to send him some stool guaiac cards which he can do at home and
send in to me by mail.  I have also sent off a CBC today.  I will plan to repeat urinalysis at his
next visit.  If he has persistent hematuria or guaiac positive stool, then we will need to discuss
more aggressive work-up, but given his overall health condition, I do not feel the need to be
aggressive at this time and would like to see him get some strength back first.

She returns for follow-up visit.  She has essential hypertension
and diabetes and is s/p a small CVA.  Medications currently include
vasotec 20 b.i.d., chlorpropamide 250 b.i.d.  I once again
encouraged her to take aspirin which she said gives her a funny
feeling in her stomach, but she is now agreeable to taking 80 mg
q.d.  Hydrochlorothiazide was stopped secondary to an episode of
hyponatremia.  She said she has felt the best over the last three
months and reports no cardiovascular or neurological symptoms. 
Blood pressure 130/70.  No JVD.  Carotid impulses normal.  No
bruits.  Lungs clear.  Cardiac exam normal.  Unremarkable abdomen. 
Full pulses throughout with no edema.  ECG is within normal limits. 
I have made no changes to her medical regimen and she will return
to see Dr. Isaiah Viola in six months.

Mr. Villegas is seen today.  I have not seen him since November. 
About three weeks ago he stopped his Prednisone on his own because
he was gaining weight.  He does feel that his shoulders are
definitely improved.  It is unclear what he is actually taking, but
I think based on the color of his pills and the timing of the
medication that he continues taking his Atenolol for hypertension
and 1 Hydroxychloroquine tablet.  He is concerned because of the
relatively recent onset of difficulties turning his head to the
right.  When he does this, he will note that he feels as though he
is going to pass out although this has not actually happened.  This
only occurs when he turns to the right and not to the left.  He has
no visual changes otherwise and denies any headache or other
cranial complaints.  
 
On examination today, BP 120/80.  He has no bruits over the
carotid.  He has no tenderness in this region either.  He has good
peripheral pulses at the arms.  His joint examination is much
improved with better ROM of the shoulders and no peripheral joint
synovitis.  
 
Clinical Impression:
 
#1:  Inflammatory arthritis - possibly RA - with response noted to
Hydroxychloroquine along with Prednisone.  He has stopped the
Prednisone, and I would not restart it yet.  
 
#2:  New onset of symptoms suspicious for right-sided carotid
disease.  Will arrange for carotid ultrasound studies.  Patient
advised to call me if he develops any worsening symptoms.  He has
been taking 1 aspirin per day prophylaxis long-term, and I stressed
that he continue to do so.  He will follow-up with me shortly after
the ultrasound study.

I saw Mr. Tanner today for a routine follow-up visit.  I last

saw him in November of 2085.  In May he presented to the

emergency room with dehydration and hyperglycemia.  Diagnosis of

non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus was made.  He is now on

Glyburide and metformin.  His renal function at that time was

normal with a BUN of 15 and creatinine of 0.90.  His potassium at

that time was 4.6.  Otherwise, he is doing pretty well.  He has

lost about 40 lb.  He has seen a nutritionist regarding dietary

counseling.  

 

Today his weight is 258 lb.  Blood pressure 120/80.  Heart rate

100.  Current medications lisinopril 40 mg p.o. q.d.,

hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 q.d., Glyburide 5 mg p.o. q.d.,

metformin 500 mg t.i.d., diltiazem 180 p.o. q.d.   Urinalysis

shows 3+ blood, 4+ protein.

 

IMPRESSION:  #1)  Thin based membrane disease with persistent

hematuria and proteinuria.  #2)  History of renal ________.  

#3)  Type 2 diabetes.

 

PLAN:  Continue current medications.   Continue high water

intake.  Encourage weight loss and compliance with his diet.  

 

I spent some time talking to him about the importance of weight

loss and controlling his diabetes given his underlying kidney

disease.  Follow-up visit in nine months.

UMALI, DANA

12423229

09/20/2077





HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Umali returns for followup after her angioplasty of a superficial femoral artery occlusive disease, with a more proximal left iliac stent placement of the common iliac. She has a nonhealing left great toe ulceration. She is followed by Dr. Holden, and I performed an endovascular recanalization.



PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Today, she is doing well, after her procedure on 09/14/77.



IMAGING: Noninvasive vascular lab studies were performed today, showing an ABI on the left of 0.67 on the right of 0.42. This is a great improvement from the 0.24 ABI on the left before the endovascular procedure.



ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: Dr. Holden explained to the patient and family about toe amputation recommendations at this time. Otherwise, from a circulatory standpoint, we counseled them that this was the optimal time to perform toe amputation to allow for primary healing.



They will follow up with Dr. Holden in 2 weeks, once they decide.

CC:         chest pain

  

HPI:

This is a 65 yo female with T2DM, HL, active smoking, breast cancer s/p BL mastectomy and chemoradiation, and a question of a lupus-like disorder who presents with chest pain.  She was seated at breakfast this AM when she developed sudden onset ripping chest pain which radiated &#8220;like a knife&#8221; to her upper back.  It was associated with nausea but no vomiting or diaphoresis or shortness of breath.  It did radiate down both arms, but she her arm pains are now new.  It was not relieved by any positioning, or largely affected by taking deep breaths.  It tapered off over about 20 minutes.  She felt fatigued and layed down, when it occurred again several hours later, again lasting for about 20 minutes.  She then presented to DCA-ED for evaluation.  She had a negative adenosine MIBI at JMH in 2078.



She has had a difficult time recently, she is under evaluation for a lupus-like syndrome (she has noted positivity for ANA, anti-smith, anti-dsDNA).  She has had progressive joint and muscle pain of all of her major joints (ankes, knees, hips, wrists, elbows, shoulders, neck, lumbar back) and the muscles of her arms and legs.  She endorses progressive mental &#8220;cloudiness&#8221;, frequently dropping items like cutlery and cups, and increasing tremor in her hands.



DCA ED Course:

Initial EKG NSR without ischemic changes

Initial biomarkers strongly positive with CKMB 33 and Troponin 0.36.  CXR unremarkable.

She was treated for NSTEMI with ASA 325 mg X 1, heparin gtt, IV lopressor.

She had a brief episode of CP which was relieved by SL NTG and morphine.

She was sent to SDU for further evaluation and treatment.

ASSESSMENT &amp; PLAN

This is a 65 yo female with T2DM, HL, active smoking, breast cancer s/p BL mastectomy and chemoradiation, and a question of a lupus-like disorder who presents with chest pain, + troponins, unremarkable EKG.  Cardiac RF = age, DM, HL, active smoking.  TIMI score = 3 (age, asa use, + biomarkers).  DDx = ACS (high risk NSTEMI), aortic dissection (concerning elements of hx), PE (given cancer hx, on SERM), or perimyocarditis (question associated with lupus-like condition).  The lack of hypoxia or tachycardia argue against PE.  Given her risk factors, after exoneration of her aorta by CT scan, she should undergo cardiac catheterization to assess for epicardial disease.  She is currently CP free.



1.    Chest pain

-     CTA chest to rule out aortic dissection now

-     If CTA negative, heparinize, begin integrilin drip (given TIMI of 3), continue ASA, statin, SL nitrate prn, likely coronary catheterization in AM.  Cycle serial cardiac enzymes and EKGs.

-     If positive, transfer to unit for invasive hemodynamic monitoring, aggressive dP/dT control, and CV surgical consult

-     TTE in AM

-     Check amylase, lipase 

-     Risk stratify with HbA1c and FLP in AM

-     Smoking cessation consult



2.    Lupus-like condition

-     Alert rheumatology team to admission in AM



3.    DM

-     Check HbA1c

-     BID NPH and AC+HS RISS



4.    Renal

-     renal prophylaxis give planned dye loads &#8211; mucormyst 1200 BID + IV bicarbonate



5.    Psych

-     continue home regimen &#8211; klonopin, effexor, topamax

(449) 515-0294



REASON FOR VISIT:  Follow up coronary disease and diabetes.



HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:

1.  The patient underwent an angioplasty on 10/07/83 and comes in

today having just had a stress test.  Stress test showed that she

was able to do a standard Bruce protocol for 7 minutes 34 seconds

achieving maximal heart rate of 116, peak blood pressure 122/60,

stopped for fatigue.  Immediately after exercise, she did have

some substernal chest pain, resolved 3 minutes into recovery. 

There were no EKG changes.  The patient reports that she has been

walking and has resumed her normal pre-hospitalization exercise

level and does not have any chest discomfort with walk, which had

precipitated the hospitalization initially.  She is looking into

cardiac rehab program but is not sure that she needs to do this. 

She feels very comfortable with her current exercise regimen. 

She has been careful with her eating and feels she is living a

healthy lifestyle.  She has returned to work.  She has follow up

scheduled with Dr. Schaefer in two days' time.

2.  Diabetes:  At last visit, I had added glyburide 5 mg to her

Glucophage 2000 mg a day.  She monitors blood sugars but only in

the morning.  Evening blood sugars are mostly in 90s to low 100s.

 However, at times during the day, she feels hypoglycemically

sweating and abdominal discomfort.  She has never actually

checked her blood sugar during these episodes as they tend to

occur at work.  She has not had any fainting or dizziness.

3.  Elevated cholesterol, is tolerating Zetia.

4.  Hypertension.  At last visit, we decreased her Avapro dose

because her blood pressure was quite low at 100/64, and

currently, she feels somewhat less fatigued.



CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Glyburide 5 mg q.d., Plavix 75 mg q.d.,

atenolol 50 mg q.d., Zetia 10 mg q.d., levoxyl 50 mcg q.d.,

Prilosec 20 mg q.d., Flexeril 10 mg q.d., Bumex 2 mg q.d.,

Pravachol 20 mg two tablets q.h.s., Avapro 75 mg q.d., Glucophage

500 mg two tablets b.i.d., and enteric-coated aspirin.



DRUG ALLERGIES:  None.



REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  She denies chest pain, palpitation, shortness

of breath, abdominal pain, or joint pain.



PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She appears in excellent health and in

good spirits.  Weight is 145, blood pressure 120/68, and pulse is

70 and regular.  Conjunctivae are clear.  Sclerae are anicteric. 

Neck is supple.  No neck vein distention.  Chest is clear to

percussion and auscultation.  Heart: Regular rhythm.  S1 and S2. 

No murmur, rub, thrill, or gallop.  Extremities are without

clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.



IMPRESSION AND PLAN:

1.  Coronary disease, doing well, status post recent angioplasty

with stenting.  Maintaining current medications of Dr. Schaefer. 

At this point, I am not sure that she actually does need cardiac

rehab, and we will defer that decision to him.

2.  Diabetes, seems as though her control is 

impressive, perhaps with recent change in her diet.  We will

discontinue the glyburide and follow up in 4 weeks.

3.  Elevated cholesterol.  We will check on lipid status in four

weeks' time.  On current medications with target of LDL less than

100.

4.  Hypertension.  Blood pressure acceptable on current medical

regimen.

Steven N Cooper M.D. 
8 Riverview Avenue, Suite 185
,
College Station, NC 22169

Dear Dr. Cooper:

  I had the pleasure of seeing your patient, Christian Mullen today in the office in followup for his peripheral artery disease, as well as his coronary disease.  I permanently follow him for PAD, as I know he follows with Dr. Fernandes for his coronary disease.

Regarding his peripheral disease, he is status post left common femoral endarterectomy, performed at my request by Dr. Fredrick Xa couple of years ago.  This alleviated some of his left leg claudication, though he still has some residual symptoms in that left calf.  The right calf is what bothers him more, with symptoms that are earlier in onset.  They occurred about 100 yards of walking on the flat.  While Chris is affected by this, it does not preclude him from doing his usual activities of daily living.  He also continues to travel (on his way to Bogalusa with Brad Fair, his partner, next week), and also continues to work actively.  The biggest problem with his claudication is that it prevents him from being physically active enough to lose enough weight.  As he says, he put on about 80 pounds after his coronary bypass graft in 2082, and he has had trouble losing the weight. He is considering weight reduction surgery, but has not made a decision about this yet.  He is struggling with the decision.

I would support him either way in this regard, encouraging him to lose weight however he can do so.

In terms of his lower extremities, his exam demonstrates diminished pulses (absent to palpation) in both ankles, but they are audible by Doppler.  Both feet are well perfused, with good capillary refill.  He has no ulcers or gangrene.

From a cardiac standpoint, Chris is doing well.  He denies significant dyspnea or chest discomfort, although he is limited in terms of walking because of his legs.  It has been 11 years since his bypass operation, and I think it would be reasonable to do a stress test on him to make certain that there is no evidence of silent ischemia.  While this might be controversial, as to whether to do a stress test or not, my own gut feeling is that it is probably the right time in this patient with significant risk factors and limitations on the basis of his lower extremity disease.  He requests specifically we do this study here, so I will take the liberty of ordering an adenosine MIBI, and certainly will forward you the results.

Otherwise, Chris is doing great.  We will continue to work on risk factor modification and I will see him again in six months.  We will also order an exercise ABI and duplex of his lower extremities to assess where we stand at the present time.  If his symptoms progress to the point where they are more disabling, then we would consider further evaluation.  Otherwise, as long as his symptoms remain stable and his lifestyle is not terribly limited, we will continue the same.


	Other Data:
   I saw him today with Vernon Galvan, one of my cardiovascular fellows, who have written a detailed note. We will send this along to you as well.

Thanks again.

Best personal regards,

Team D Intern Admission Note

Patient Name Here: Olivo, Kimberly

MR# 3299811

Location: Suite 53-02Q

Date of Admission:  December 15, 2091	

PCP:	Isaac Ng 



ID/CC:	Change in mental status



HPI:  70 y/o Female with PMHx significant for Pituitary adenoma s/p resection, cryptogenic cirrhosis, presenting with confusion for the past 3 days. Patient confused and unable to give history at time of admission. As per son and daughter, they have noticed increasing confusion and inappropriate behavior over the past 3 days. They report that she has woken up in the middle of the night c/o feeling weak and confused. The first two nights, her son treated her  initially with increasing lactulose administration when she would wake up at night (although it is unclear whether she had any increase in her stool) and he reports that she would behave better during the day. On the night prior to administration, the patient urinated in her bed at night and called her daughter on the phone in the middle of the night. She also forgot the names of her grandchildren. The son became worried about her behavior, contacted her PCP, and brought her to the ALH ED.



The family reports that she experienced similar behavior prior to grand-mal seizures that were a consequence of uncontrolled hypertension about 2 yrs ago. She also suffers from chronic UTI's and often becomes confused during times of infection.





ED Course: Vitals T 98.2, HR 64, BP 215, 115, RR 24, Sa02 100% NRB. 

Blood Pressure: Treated with labetalol 10 mg IV x 1, Hydral 10 mg IV x 1, decreased to 176/74. 

Hyponatremia: NS x 1 L





PMH:

Pituitary adenoma  2080 s/p resection, XRT

Diabetes mellitus Type II - On Humulin 15/15 

Hypertension - on Avapro, allergy to Ace-I

Angina pectoris - negative stress 



Seizure - According to discharge summaries in YPZ, patient had two episodes of general tonic-clonic seizures at OSH prior to transfer to ALH. Extensive neuro work-up at ALH including MRI/MRA, carotid non-invasives, TCVs, EEG, LP revealed no definitive etiology of seizure but thought to be likely related to her uncontrolled hypertension with systolic BP 250's, her morbid state in setting of UTI, and lower seizure threshold with ciprofloxacin.



Hyperlipidemia - was on zocor, recently switched to zetia, ?myositis

Hypothyroid - central, secondary to pituitary XRT

Arthritis   



Cryptogenic cirrhosis - HIV, HBV, HCV negative (4/90), ANA negative, Anti-mitochondrial Ab negative, no evidence of hemachromatosis, alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency or Wilson's disease on biopsy, findings consistent with NASH.

CXR: 

no acute cardiopulmonary process



HEAD CT:

	CT HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST

	History: Mental status change. Right sided weakness. Hypertension.

	Procedure: Contiguous axial images of the head were performed from

	the skull base to the vertex without intravenous contrast. Bone

	and soft-tissue windows were reviewed.

	Comparison: MRI dated 7/16/91

	Findings:

	The cerebral parenchyma, posterior fossa, basal cisterns and

	ventricular system appear normal. There is no evidence of any mass

	or mass effect. There is no evidence of acute infarction although

	this would be better assessed by MR with diffusion. There is no

	evidence of parenchymal or extra-axial hemorrhage.

	A right frontal mucocele has enlarged since the previous exam. It

	extends into the right orbit resulting in proptosis.  There are

	bilateral lens implants.

	

IMPRESSION:

	No acute intracranial hemorrhage. Enlarging right frontal mucocele

	which causes right proptosis.



Pituitary MRI: (7/91)

	No evidence of recurrent pituitary adenoma.  Interval increase in

	the size of an expansile lesion within the right ethmoid bed, with

	increased extension into the right orbit.  The lesion contacts the

	right globe.  This lesion most likely represents a mucocele.

	

EKG:	NSR @ 73, normal axis, normal intervals, biphasic t wave v2, no sttw changes.

      PEAK DOUBLE PRODUCT:    11096

ENDPOINT(S):

The protocol was completed. Chest pain did not occur.

The baseline cardiac rhythm was normal sinus rhythm. The rest

electrocardiogram revealed nonspecific ST segment and T-wave

abnormalities. Small inferior q's.  No ST segment changes were observed during this test.  Negative for ischemia. However, the sensitivity of Adenosine-induced ST segment changes for detecting significant CAD is limited.

SCAN RESULTS:

The left ventricle is normal in size. Regional left ventricular perfusion is normal. The left ventricular ejection fraction was 77% on the stress study. Regional wall motion was normal on the stress study.

CONCLUSIONS:

The ECG response to pharmacological stress was  negative for ischemia. The myocardial scans are within normal limits and do not demonstrate evidence of myocardial ischemia or infarction.

 bilaterally.  Ophthalmic artery flow is normal in direction, via the

 transorbital approach, bilaterally.  Ultrasound visualization of the

 bifurcations is good.  There is dense plaque visualized in each bifurcation.

 Plaque does not alter flow in either vessel.



 IMPRESSIONS:

1.	MINIMAL DISEASE OF BOTH CAROTID ARTERY BIFURCATION.



LIVER, BIOPSY: (11/2089)

     

     NOTE:  There is established cirrhosis, confirmed on trichrome

     stain.  There is a mild to moderate mixed portal tract

     inflammatory infiltrate, composed of lymphocytes, plasma cells,

     and eosinophils.  There is no interface or lobular activity.

     There is mild macrovesicular steatosis. There are scattered

     glycogenated nuclei in periportal hepatocytes, consistent with

     diabetes and/or obesity. There is mild periportal edema and

     copper deposition, consistent with chronic cholestasis. There is

     no Mallory's hyaline.  There is no evidence of hemachromatosis,

     alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency or Wilson's disease based on iron,

     PAS/D, and copper stains, respectively. The inflammatory

     infiltrate is not ductulocentric, and there is minimal bile duct

     damage. Immunostains for cytokeratins 7 and 19 highlight

     bile ductular reduplication, but there is no ductopenia. The

     findings of cirrhosis are not specific, but are compatible with

     end-stage non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).

Dear Dr. Swanson:



I had the pleasure of caring for Clarence Hess at BCH 08/04-03/07.  He is a 54-year-old man with obesity, dyslipidemia and hypertension, S/P dual-chamber pacemaker placement by Dr. Una Trujillo in February, 2060.  He complained of fatigue and exertional throat tightness and a nuclear stress test in June, 2060, revealed apical ischemia and an ejection fraction of 70 percent.  Cardiac catheterization performed by Dr. Leslie Campbell on 08/04/60 via the right radial artery revealed a right dominant system, a tight lesion in the proximal LAD, and no other focally occlusive disease.  He received a 3mm stent, postdilated to 3.5mm, with an excellent angiographic result.  



He spent an uneventful night without complaints, ambulating and voiding without difficulty.  His right wrist was stable, and his hand warm and well perfused.  Morning labs included a BUN of 16, creatinine 0.9, negative cardiac enzymes, hematocrit 36.4, platelets 238,000, cholesterol 182, HDL 37, LDL 91 and triglycerides 269.  He was discharged home on aspirin, 325mg po qd; Plavix, 75mg po qd, to be continued for at least six months according to the research trial protocol; atenolol, 50mg po qd; Lipitor, 80mg po qd; Prilosec, 20mg po qd; Proventil, two puffs qid; and sublingual nitroglycerin, prn chest pain.  We've asked him to see you in the next couple of weeks, and to call if he has questions before then.  He also will follow up with the research staff per protocol guidelines.  Thank you for allowing us to participate in his care.  Please don't hesitate to call with questions.

Vernon, ME 27525



RE:  		Jaquante Xuereb

SRI: 		134-43-51



Dear Dr. You:



Thank you for asking me to consult in the care of this complex patient.  Mr. Xuereb is a 55-year-old white male who presents with an ischemic right foot.  He has a longstanding history of lower extremity occlusive disease and has worked as a high school principle.  He has undergone previous right SFA angioplasty in 2059, previous left SFA angioplasty and stent placement in 2062, previous right fem-pop above-knee bypass grafting in February 2070, previous left leg fem-pop bypass grafting with saphenous vein in April 2070 and a redo right fem below-knee popliteal bypass graft with a bifid saphenous vein performed in September 2070.  After this last procedure, the patient at the time of follow-up office visit was noted to have a nonfunctioning graft with an ischemic right lower extremity.  He denies any history of trauma.  He is a former smoker.  He denies any history of hypercoagulable states or history of significant coronary disease.  He does have longstanding non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus as well as hypertension and COPD.



Past surgical history is as above.



Medications include Glucophage, Lopid, Prilosec, Norvasc, hydrochlorothiazide, Lipitor, Effexor, Plavix 75 mg q.d., aspirin, albuterol, Serevent, Nasacort and Pulmicort.



No known drug allergies.



Review of systems is positive for diabetes, asthma and hypertension.  All other review of systems is negative as per H&P sheet.



Habits, he is a former tobacco smoker.  He denies alcohol use.



Family history is positive for MI, stroke and cancer.



On physical exam, the patient is a well-developed and well-nourished male in moderate discomfort.  Respiratory rate is 12-14.  Pulse is 60-70 and regular.  Weight is 172 pounds.  Blood pressure is 170/90 in the right arm, 150/90 in the left.  No jugular venous distention.  Normal respiratory effort.  Lungs are clear to auscultation.  Heart, regular rate and rhythm.  No murmur or bruit.  He has no palpable abdominal aortic aneurysm.  He has normal carotid, brachial, radial and femoral pulses bilaterally.  Absent pedal pulses on the right with Doppler signals, which are monophasic.  On the left side, he has adequately perfused foot with normal capillary refill and Doppler signals.  He has moderate edema in the right lower extremity.  No varicosities.  He does have dependent rubor, cyanosis of the right forefoot and purplish discoloration of the tips of the right second to fifth toes.  The right great toe is blanched.  He has no abdominal masses, tenderness or hepatosplenomegaly.  He has grossly intact musculoskeletal tone and strength with no dermatitis, ulcers or sores.  He is alert and oriented to person, place and time with slightly depressed affect.



Assessment and Plan:  



1. Ischemic right lower extremity consistent with thrombosed bypass graft.  We will plan to admit the patient for treatment with intravenous heparin and plan to schedule him for an urgent arteriogram within the next 24 hours.  We will attempt to identify any possible way to re-establish flow  with either thrombolysis and/or angioplasty and stenting.  If this is unsuccessful, he will ultimately require redo fem-pop bypass graft.

2. Tobacco abuse:  The patient needs to continue to remain abstinent from smoking.

3. Hypertension:  Moderately controlled on current medications.  His previous angiogram did not reveal any evidence of any hemodynamically significant renal artery stenosis.  We will adjust him as appropriate from a medical standpoint.  

4. Non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus.  The patient's blood sugars are currently under good control on Glucophage, which we will need to hold post arteriogram.  I will keep you informed as to the status of this very nice patient.  



Thank you for allowing me to participate in his management.  If I can be of any further assistance and management of this or any of your patients with cerebrovascular, aortic, renovascular or low peripheral vascular disease, particularly those in need of a minimally invasive vascular procedure, please feel free to contact me directly.  



Sincerely,







Shane R. Herring, M.D.

SDU ADMISSION NOTE



PATIENT:  XAYAVONG, BRANDON

MRN:  7826250

ADMIT DATE: 6/13/2082

PCP: DR. ERNEST EDGE

ATTENDING PHYSICIAN: DR. ASHLEI TYSON

OUTPATIENT CARDIOLOGIST: DR. BRIAN MOSS (772-261-4350)



CHIEF COMPLAINT: fatigue, lightheadedness



HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS

Mr. Xayavong is a 61M h/o CAD (anterior STEMI 2077, stents x2 to LAD, 4 stents since then, last 2080), DM, CHF unknown EF, HTN, who p/w ~3 days of nonspecific symptoms of fatigue, nausea, and poor sleep.



He receives most of his care at Duluth Clinic-Hermantown (Dr. Moss).  Two weeks ago, he had BiV/ICD placement, as well as left heart catheterization that showed, per verbal report, &#8220;multivessel disease difficult for CABG.&#8221;  He says he also had a chemical stress study but is unsure of the results.  He reports that he was then referred to GNC for high-risk CABG (Dr. U. Wyatt) and potential heart transplant evaluation (Dr. A. Tyson).  



He feels that since the BiV/ICD placement he has been feeling more tired, specifically in the past 3 days, wherein he reports fatigue, nausea, poor sleep, exertional lightheadedness.  He has not had chest pain (he did have chest pain with prior two MIs), palpitations, vomiting, diarrhea.  He does have some orthopnea, but no PND and LE swelling intermittently, but not at present.  To his knowledge, he has never had a tachyarrhythmia.  However, he does note that he was started on digoxin a few weeks ago, tried it for 1 week, then had fatigue, nausea, GI upset, and that the medication was then discontinued.



On arrival, he had HR 135, BP 106/73 with some drops to low of 80/50.  Felt to be VT versus Afib with aberrancy.  EP was consulted, interrogated his device, and confirmed that he was in Afib (and that it had never fired or detected VT/VF).  He was given amio load 300 and drip at 1mg/min, with some HR response to 100-120s.  For hyperkalemia to 5.1, he was given calcium gluconate, insulin, D50, bicard; and his Mg was repleted.  Given his persistent symptoms, per EP recs, he was started on heparin drip with 5000 units bolus.  (He is not on Coumadin at baseline; he takes toprol XL 12.5mg only.)  CXR by report was clear.  With admiodarone, BPs dropped to 75; upon discontinuation, BPs back up to 80s, then 90s.  Of note, he says his baseline HR is 80s and SBP is 90s.

RADIOLOGICAL STUDIES

CXR 6/6: clear lungs



EKG: AFib with aberrancy at 98bpm, LBBB morphology, LAD, TWI V5/V6, I/aVL

       

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

Mr. Xayavong is a 61M h/o CAD (anterior STEMI 2077, stents x2 to LAD, 4 stents since then, last 2080), DM, CHF unknown EF, HTN, who p/w a couple days of nonspecific symptoms of fatigue, nausea, and poor sleep.  He presented with atrial fibrillation with RVR, with moderate response to IV amiodarone load and bolus but hypotension.  He has known multivessel disease felt by report to be a high-risk CABG candidate, and is doubly referred for heart transplant evaluation.



# CV/RHYTHM: Afib/RVR, with generalized nonspecific symptoms

- Not ideally controlled on amiodarone given hypotension, but can tolerate SBP 90s given this is his baseline and no evidence of hypoperfusion

- Trial digoxin low-dose versus cautiously titrating diltiazem or metoprolol

- Bolus NS as needed for low BPs

- High risk for clot given likely prolonged Afib, however, CHADS is 2 or 3 (HTN, DM, ?CHF)

- Heparinize, hold on Coumadin bridge in case of possible procedures

- Tele, replete lytes



# CV/ISCHEMIA: Known multivessel disease, difficult to CABG per OSH cardiologist

- ASA, hold BB/ACEI given hypotention, statin, niacin, check lipids

- Given no clear cause for Afib and comorbid with DM, trend cardiac markers

- Ongoing outpatient eval for CABG 



# CV/PUMP: Unknown EF, mild crackles on exam, taking lasix QOD at home. Relatively euvolemic.

- Continue lasix QOD regimen

- Check TTE for new WMA, worsening cardiomyopathy

- Will discuss plan with Heart Failure service



# DM: Hold glipizide, metofrmin while in house. RISS + FSBG AC/HS



FEN: cardiac

NAME:    Werner, Brian  

MRN:     4097229



This patient reports approximately 3-4 years ago he had episodes of right sided

visual loss.  He thought it was only related to his right eye.  What he describes is a

right peripheral hemispheric visual loss.  He reports having a history of headaches

in the past.  It is nothing that is significantly worse than usual.  On Thursday he

reports having a mild bitemporal headache and then later that day ensuing right

peripheral loss that has lasted for the past 3-4 days.  In the past his visual loss only

lasted for about one day.  He denies any other focal neurological complaints.



PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension.  He is on a baby aspirin a day.  He

denies any further headaches.  He denies any numbness, tingling or weakness on

one side of his body or other.  He has chronic left knee problems from an old

injury.  He is unable to bend the leg.  He has no new problems with his gait.  He

denies any symptoms of jaw claudication.  



PHYSICAL EXAM:  His exam reveals no temporal artery tenderness to palpation. 

His funduscopic exam appears normal on undilated exam.  His visual fields reveals

what appears to be consistent with right bilateral hemianopsia.  PERRLA.  EOMI. 

Cranial nerves II-XII are otherwise intact.  His motor strength is 5/5.  He has no

pronator drift.  His cerebellar exam is intact.  His blood pressure is 150/100.

Carotid - no bruit.  Cor - RRR no MGR Lungs - CTA

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  Question bilateral hemianopsia.  The patient will get

scheduled for an MRI/MRA as soon as possible.  He was sent to the NDMG
Ophthalmology Clinic to confirm bilateral vs. unilateral hemianopsia (central vs. peripheral etiology) today for further evaluation plus/minus ESR and CBC at

that point in time.

RE:		Jarvis, Amador

PCC#:		090-73-07



January 20, 2088



Reason for visit:  Mr. Jarvis comes to follow up on his hypertension, hyperglycemia, renal insufficiency and elevated PSA.  



HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  He has seen Dr. Jose Quirk and a prostate biopsy has been recommended.  This is scheduled for next week and Mr. Jarvis is quite anxious about it.  



He began the Captopril and HCTZ (? or Maxide) and has noted good blood pressure control as checked at BH.  At first he developed a considerable cough but in the last two weeks this has largely resolved.  He states that the cough is productive of thick phlegm and may reflect a respiratory infection rather than the Captopril itself.  His blood sugars when checked at home have averaged between the 140 to 150 range fasting.  On one occasion a three hour postprandial was 170.  



He has had no attacks of gout or gout like arthritis in the past six weeks and is quite pleased about this. 



He has continued actively managing production and is planning a trip to Italy next month.  



PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination today he looks well and comfortable.  His blood pressure is 140/76 right arm sitting with regular pulse of 68.  His weight is 173 (stable).  



IMPRESSION:  Doing reasonably well on the new blood pressure program.  Since the cough is resolving it would seem reasonable to continue the present program.  



We will look forward to seeing the results of the prostate biopsy and we will check glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin today.  He will return in four months for follow up.  





Orvell Oliver, M.D. 

Labs:  Hemolyzed sample shows K of 6.0.  Will check re HCTZ vs Maxide.  If the latter, will change it.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  He has not had recurrent angina.  Unfortunately, we did not connect back in December following the receipt of his lipid data that included a marked and unacceptable LDL elevation.  We had left a message with his daughter, Lea.  Additional laboratory data at that time included a hemoglobin A1c of 6.2%.

He is seeking to establish a new relationship with a primary care physician through Barney Convalescent Hospital.  He has also had problems of at least 2 years duration with erectile dysfunction and decreased libido.

MEDICATIONS:  His medications are atenolol 50 mg b.i.d., atorvastatin 80 mg daily, ezetimibe 10 mg daily, Ecotrin 325 mg daily, Prilosec 20 mg daily.  He apparently ran out of his clopidogrel some time ago and did not renew the prescription.  It was his understanding that he was to remain on this medication for only six months following the PCI procedure.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  His heart rate at rest is 105.  His initial blood pressure 149/96, but then 150/82 on repeat, using a large cuff.  His weight is down 4 pounds to 193.  His venous pressure and carotid upstrokes are normal.  His lung fields are clear.  He has no cardiac murmur.  There are no pulse deficits or peripheral edema.

His ECG shows a sinus tachycardia (after rushing into the office) and an incomplete right bundle-branch block pattern with a normal QRS duration.  In comparison with his tracing from 12/24/2060, his resting heart rate has increased.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  He will keep a diary of blood pressure and heart rate recordings over the next month on the basis of which we will determine next steps.  It is possible that the higher dose beta-blocker contributes to his erectile dysfunction, though the problem may have antedated this medication altogether.  We will refer him to the practice of Dr. Ohara and Dr. Xiao, as well as to Dr. Sutherland, the latter specifically to help us evaluate his longstanding erectile dysfunction.

He will continue his efforts at weight loss.  He is working out at the gym 2-3 times per week.

NAME:     Olivo, Kimberly

MRN:      3299811 



INITIAL VISIT 



This is a 69-year-old white female coming for her fu visit. 



The patient has a history of type II diabetes mellitus and pituitary adenoma and

recently was hospitalized at American Legion Hospital with general malaise

syndrome and back/chest pain.  Initially the patient was seen at Neligh Clinic and cardiac ischemia was ruled out.  She was found to have a blood

pressure of 250 systolic at Neligh Clinic associated with persistent

headaches.  She was transferred to American Legion Hospital after being

found collapsed on the floor of the hospital bathroom.  She was transferred to the

Intensive Care Unit at Neligh Clinic and treated for tonic-clonic

convulsions with diazepam and lorazepam. She also suffered a urinary tract

infection in hospital, treated with Cipro.



She was transferred to the American Legion Hospital on October 02, 2089,

at which time she was awake but unable to give a history. 



On admission to American Legion Hospital she had a blood pressure of

127/70, pulse was 80, and temperature was 99.3.  She had a myxedematous face and

was obese.  She was cardiovascularly stable.  Neurologically, she was able to move

all four extremities with good strength and symmetrical reflexes.  Cranial nerves

intact.  Initially, the impression was that patient suffered seizure secondary to

elevated blood pressure.  Most likely, she suffered hypertensive encephalopathy. 

Patient underwent neurologic evaluation including MRA of the brain, lumbar

puncture, both of which were negative.  Electroencephalogram was  performed and

showed no epileptiform foci and diffuse temporal slowing bilaterally.  The patient's

alertness and responsiveness increased gradually during the hospital stay.  She had

an episode of chest pain which was associated with some ST flattening in the lateral

leads.  Acute cardiac event was ruled out.  The patient underwent a course of

physical therapy and then, finally, was transferred to a rehabilitation facility.  A

specific cause of the patient's seizure was not found although it was assumed that

this might have been provoked by the hypertensive encephalopathy associated with

use of ciprofloxacin for the treatment of the UTI which could have lowered her

threshold for seizure activity.  Upon discharge, the patient was in stable condition.



PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Remarkable for seizure, type II diabetes mellitus,

panhypopituitarism secondary to pituitary surg, hypertension, right arm bone

tumor excision associated with right radial neuropathy, and hyperlipidemia.



MEDICATIONS:  See LMR.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Negative.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Denies alcohol intake, smoking.



REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Denies visual or hearing disturbance, headaches,

weakness, numbness, seizure activity, chest pain, palpitations, syncope, dyspnea,

wheezing, cough, coryza, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain. 



Positive for mild nocturia with no dysuria.  No polydipsia.  Positive mild

paresthesias right upper extremity.  Occasional mid-morning reactions.  Home

blood glucose monitoring b.i.d. with most glucose readings between 100 and 200. 

Positive mild tiredness without any hoarseness, heat or cold intolerance.  Mild

arthralgia.  No bleeding, rash, pruritus. 



Diet:  Low salt.  Mets 2-3. 



ALLERGIES:  Sulfa, codeine, morphine. 



PHYSICAL EXAM:  General appearance:  Well-developed, well-nourished.  Vital

signs:  Blood pressure 130/80, respiratory rate 18, heart rate 76, temperature

afebrile.  HEENT exam:  No exophthalmos, no lid lag, equally reactive pupils,

difficult to visualize fundi; pharynx clear; ears clear.  Neck:  No JVD, no bruits,

thyroid within normal limits.   Chest:  Clear, no rales or wheezes.  Heart sounds

normal.  No murmurs.  Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, no organomegaly.  Extremities: 

No edema.  Neuro:  Awake and alert although at times forgets details of past

history; no focal neurologic signs.  



A/P:  

1.   Type II diabetes mellitus.good control.  Plan - Continue diet. 



2.   Panhypopituitarism secondary to  pituitary surgery for pituitary adenoma. 

     Need to obtain record from surgeon for details on what type of tumor this

     was.  Patient on replacement therapy with levothyroxine and prednisone. 

     She will continue both with the understanding that should she become sick

     for whatever reason she needs to double or triple dose her prednisone and

     contact me.  She needs to wear a bracelet for this as well as for her diabetes. 

     

3.   Seizure disorder, ? etiology.  She saw the neurologist; she will need to remain on anti-seizure medications.  



4.   Hyperlipidemia:  Plan - Check fast lipid profile.  Discussed with Dr Xavier;P:: lipitor 10 mg /d.



5  Cryptogenic cirrhosis, LFT ok; discussed with Dr Xavier ; no absolute contraindication to lipitor.



6  ? CAD x family; no clear documet; P: adenosine MIBI  since pt is diabetic and unable to perform exercis eETT.



WT loss ? etiol; ct abd neg and cxr neg; P: colonoscopy.

Reason for Visit

Mr. Oshea is here for f/u of diabetes, other issues.  We increased his 70/30 insulin from 30 to 35U BID last month.  He has been keeping track of sugars at least BID since then.  He still has the majority of sugars in the low 200 range, some in the 300's, a few in the 100's.  Interestingly, his fasting sugars are for the most part higher than his daytime sugars.  He has not been adhering to a good diabetes diet - he enjoys a blueberry muffin from RR Donnelley daily.  His daughter-in-law who is also my patient has told me that he eats anything he wants and all the wrong things.  I addressed this issue w/ Mr. Oshea.  He says he tries, but he enjoys these things and feels he doesn't have much else in life to enjoy.  He is worried about his remaining vision.  He was told by Dr. Villagomez that the pressure in his L eye was unusually high.  She wants to see him back again this month for another exam and wants him to bring his eye drops.  He also is having trouble sleeping.  He never had a great sleep pattern since he worked as a Senior Manager of Broadcasting and was up at all hours.  He has no trouble falling asleep, but wakes up about 2 a.m. every morning and can't fall back asleep.  He does take naps in the afternoon at times.

RE:  Wagner, Lonnie

     MR #097-87-37-2

 

Dear Cecilia;

 

I had the pleasure of seeing Lonnie in the Clinic today.  As you

know, he is a 72-year-old gentleman recently diagnosed with

myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative syndrome.  He has required

blood cell transfusions for this.  He is currently receiving

Hydrea for this.  He also has coronary disease, for which he had

stents placed in his LAD and OM in 07/65.  This has been stable. 

He also had some congestive heart failure, for which he has no

further symptoms at this time.  His weight is only up 1-2 pounds

but has remained stable with an increased appetite.  

 

Medications: Include atenolol 25 mg p.o. q.d., aspirin 325 mg

q.d., vitamin B12 injections q. monthly, metformin 850 mg t.i.d.,

lisinopril 10 mg p.o. q.d., Lasix 40 mg p.o. q.d. 

 

Physical Examination: Blood pressure: 102/60.  Heart rate: 60

beats/min.  Neck examination reveals no jugular venous distention 

Chest examination is clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Cardiac

examination reveals normal S1, physiologically split S2, no

evidence of a murmurs, rubs or gallops at this time.  He has no

peripheral edema or clubbing.  

 

EKG: Normal sinus rhythm, nonspecific ST or T wave abnormalities. 

Compared to his prior EKG, T wave changes in the anterior leads

are improved.  

Wagner, Lonnie

MR #097-87-37-2               -2-                 September 29, 2065 

 

Impression: Mr. Wagner is doing very well from an ischemic and

heart failure perspective.  He remains on a good regimen of

afterload reduction and anti-ischemic agents.  At this time, I do

not recommend any changes in his cardiac medications.  

 

The patient was seen in consultation with Dr. Jacqueline Lam. 

 

Sincerely,

                                      PROMPTCAREIMA Clinic Note



Mrs. Rutledge is a former patient of Dr. Xia's who comes in today to establish a new PCP and for follow-up of her hypertension, diabetes, chronic renal insufficiency (baseline creatinine 2.2), and GERD.  She is currently on procardia xl, losartan, and atenolol for her hypertension.  She takes a baby aspirin qd for cardiac protection.  Her diabetes is controlled by diet alone, and her GERD by zantac 150 qd or bid prn.  Her last HbA1C was 6.9, with a malb/cr ratio of 222.2 and trace protein on U/A.  She has had a prior cardiac work-up for atypical chest pain with a negative ETT/SPECT in 2062 and a negative ETT in 2064.  An echo in 2062 showed an EF of 65% with no valvular abnormalities.



She is currently well with no complaints.  She is being followed in opthalmology for possible glaucoma.  She does not check her blood sugars at home, although she has a glucometer.  When asked if her sugars are ever low, she states that she has the same symptoms with hypoglycemia that she does with hyperglycemia: dizziness and hot flashes.  She's not had this recently.  She also does not check her BP at home.  She denies any numbness or tingling in her fingers, or any chest pain.  She did pull a muscle in her shoulder last night and still feels tender in that area.  She follows a diabetic diet (avoids sweets), gets no regular exercise, but works in Electrical and Avionics Mechanics so does have physical activity during the day.



PSHx: none

PGynHx: G7 P4 SAB1 TAB2, still menstruating q month, no hot flashes, heavy periods but no clots; LMP 10/01/66

Allergies: NKAD

Habits: never smoked, very rare EtOH, no illicit drugs

HEENT:   PERLA, anicteric, O/P clear

Neck:      no thyromegaly or LAN; no carotid bruits

Chest:     lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally with no crackles 

Heart:      regular rate and rhythm, S1 and S2 normal, no m/g/r

Pelvic:     Pap done, with normal vaginal mucosa and cervix

Ext:  no edema, peripheral pulses present and feet without lesions.



Assessment:  51 yo woman with diabetes, hypertension, CRI from hypertension/diabetic nephropathy likely. 



Current Plan:

1.  Diabetes.  Checking A1C off medication.  Would like to have patient check FS when she's feeling ill or if A1C is elevated.  Will refer to NP for review glucometer use, diabetic diet.  She has been tried on glucotrol XL in the past and was hypoglycemia.  This is also probably not a good choice due to her renal insufficiency.  May try glyburide if A1C elevated.  Being followed by opthalmology with upcoming appt.  Podiatry referral deferred.  Consider repeat referral to nutrition.  Lipids very good (LDL 82) last check off medication.

2.  Hypertension.  BP borderline elevated today, but off atenolol.  HR also up.  Refilled all meds; will ask NP to check her pressure at next visit.  Will continue qd ASA for CAD/stroke prevention.

3.  GERD.  Continue zantac bid as needed.  Also recommended that patient start using Tums for calcium supplementation and relief of intermittent dyspepsia.  She will try this and get back to me about the effect.

4.  Chronic renal insufficiency.  Will get 24-hour urine to assess creatinine clearance and urine protein.  Checking chem 7 today for K and Creatinine.

5.  Health maintenance.  Patient due to dT shot, requested today.  Normal mammogram in 5/66.  Stool guaiac and flex sig can be done at next appt; will follow-up Pap.

Infectious Disease Consult Note 


Pt: Rose Mack
MR#: 06129040

Consult Date: 3/19/94



CC/RFC: 
Pt is a 52 year old w/ chronic R heel wound, now w/ wound infection. Consultation was requested by Dr. Katz for recommendations regarding antibiotic management.



HPI:  Pt has longstanding DM and PVD complicated by severe R foot ulceration. She underwent R femoral to posterior tibial bypass graft in 5/92 and skin grafting in 7/92. R heel wound subsequently improved but pt developed L plantar ulceration requiring debridement 10/92. Cultures grew MSSA. Pt was subsequently treated w/ extended course of doxycycline, rifampin through 2/93. She subsequently did well until developing R heel ulcer while undergoing psychiatric hospitalization in mid 2/94. She was initially hospitalized at Altadena Hospital, where she underwent debridement of wound and treatment w/ extended course of penicillin VK and probenicid. Wound failed to improve. Pt was rehospitalized on 3/18 at GCCfor further management. She underwent incision and debridement on 3/18. Intraoperative evaluation revealed ulcer wound tracking to bone. Intraoperative gram stain revealed GPCs in pairs. Intraoperative cultures are pending. Pt was subsequently treated w/ vancomycin, levofloxacin and metronidazole. 




On interview, pt reports feeling generally well. No F/C/NS. Appetite normal. Had  previously noted creeping erythema up R leg, now resolved.



PMH (from EMR)

DM type 1: c/b PVD, neuropathy, nephropathy

PVD: s/p right mid superficial femoral artery to mid posterior tibial bypass graft with reversed ipsilateral greater saphenous vein

CKD

Impression
52F w/ DM, PVD and hx of R heel ulceration s/p skin grafting in 5/92 and L midfoot MSSA infection in 9/92, now w/ relapse of R heel ulceration. Intraoperative cultures show involvement of bone. Clinical picture is concerning for osteomyelitis. Possible culprit organisms include drug resistant Staphylococcus aureus, which should be treated empirically while awaiting cultures. Pt will likely require an extended course of IV therapy for treatment of osteomyelitis.



Recommendations

 



Follow up intraoperative cultures

Continue vancomycin 1g IV Q24H; check trough prior to fourth dose.

Discontinue levofloxacin, metronidazole.

Mr. Tanner RTC to discuss diabetes, BP, weight, lipids.



HPI: He has been overweight for some time, and was found to have DM II about two years ago. I had treated him with:

GLYBURIDE  5MG PO BID

METFORMIN  500MG PO TID

LISINOPRIL  40MG PO QD

DILTIAZEM CD  180MG PO QD

HCTZ  12.5MG PO QD



however he enrolled in a study, and when it was over he was put on:



DILTIAZEM CD 180 MG     PO QD 

HYZAAR (25 MG/100 MG) (HCTZ 25MG   LOSART... 1 TAB     PO QD 



When I found his A1c to be 8.7%, I added back 5 mg QD of glyburide which he has been taking for < 1 month. He feels well. He says he's lost 10 lbs. since his last visit (262 lbs. on 2/26 - 263 lbs. today) but he's interested in a weight loss program.



MEDICATIONS

DILTIAZEM CD 180 MG     PO QD 

HYZAAR (25 MG/100 MG) (HCTZ 25MG   LOSART... 1 TAB     PO QD 

GLYBURIDE 5 MG     PO QD  



ALLERGIES

NKDA  NONE  



SH: single, Ground Transit Operators Supervisor at HASBRO.



Habits: no cigarettes, drugs or alcohol;



ROS: denies weight change, fever, chills, fatigue, blurry vision, chest pains, palpitations, dyspnea, cough, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, change in bowel/bladder habits, joint pain, dizziness, exanthem, edema. No concerns about pain, functional status or nutritional status.



PE notable for:

Well nourished well appearing obese WM;

VITAL SIGNS

BLOOD PRESSURE  152/84

PULSE  68

WEIGHT  263

HEENT: sclera clear white OU, EOMI, ear canals and TMs wnl AU; oropharynx without lesions.

LN: No palpable neck or SC LN;

Cardiac: RRR, rate   68 , no extra sounds

Resp.: good air movement, no accessory muscle use, no adventitious sounds



Plan:

1. by his account DM control is still poor, which is not surprising since he previously required 10 mg of glyburide and 1500 mg of metformin per day. For now I will increase glyburide to 5 mg BID.

2. also poor BP control for a diabetic. Increasing Diltiazem to 240 mg QD. It's unfortunate that he was taken off lisinopril.

3. MALB has improved but is still high; reports suggest Diltiazem might help with this.

4. discussed necessity for weight loss for DM, BP, lipids.

5. RTC 1 month.
